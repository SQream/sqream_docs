Preparing for Release Notes
***********************
As soon as you finish publish one set of release notes, it is wise to begin working on next one for a few hours a day. This will give you ample time to make any required or unpredicable last-minute changes should they arise.

.. tip:: The **upcoming_releases** Slack channel is dedicated for discussions related to new releases. This channel is very active and contains important information relevant to new releases.

The best way to prepare for the next release notes is to:

1. Identify and document all features that need to be documented based on internal PRD documents.

    ::

2. Identify and document all bugs that need to be documented.

New features must be documented in the following places:

1. On the main release notes page for the new version.

    ::

2. When relevant, in our existing documentation, such as **Feature Guides**, **Reference Guides,** and/or **Configuration Guides**.

Once you've completed the first draft of a new page or section, you should do the following:

1. Generate a PDF of the page.

    ::

2. Upload it to Google Docs and share it with the relevant people.

    ::

3. Integrate all comments.

    ::

4. Create a second draft and repeat steps 2 and 3.

    ::

5. On the release date, publish all documentation.

.. warning:: Make sure to view and test all page functionality, such as links, on build files before publishing your content to live branches.
