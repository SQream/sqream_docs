SQream DB on Cloud
************
SQream DB can now be run on AWS, GCP, and Azure.

Numeric Data Types
************
SQream now supports Numeric Data types for the following operations:

   * All join types.
   * All aggregation types (not including Window functions).
   * Scalar functions (not including some trigonometric and logarithmic functions).
   
For more information, see `Numeric Data Types <https://docs.sqream.com/en/v2021.1/reference/sql_data_types.html#numeric-data-types.html>`_.

Text Data Type
************
SQream now supports TEXT data types in all operations, which is default string data type for new projects.


 * Sqream supports VARCHAR functionalty, but recommends using TEXT.

 * TEXT data enhancements introduced in Release Notes version 2020.3.1:
 
   * Support text columns in queries with multiple distinct aggregates.
   * Text literal support for all functions.
   
For more information, see `String Types <https://docs.sqream.com/en/v2021.1/reference/sql_data_types.html#string-types-text-varchar>`_.


Supports Scalar Subqueries
************
SQream now supports running initial scalar subqueries.

For more information, see `Subqueries <https://docs.sqream.com/en/v2021.1/reference/sql/sql_syntax/subqueries.html>`_.

Literal Arguments
************

SQream now supports literal arguments for functions in all cases where column/scalar arguments are supported.

Simple Scalar SQL UDFs
************
SQream now supports simple scalar SQL UDF's.

For more information, see `Simple Scalar SQL UDFâ€™s <https://docs.sqream.com/en/v2021.1/reference/sql/sql_functions/user_defined_functions/scalar_sql_udf.html>`_.

Logging Enhancements
************
The following log information has been added for the following events:

  * Compilation start time.
  * When the first metadata callback in the compiler (if relevant).
  * When the last metadata callback in the compiler (if relevant).
  * When the log started attempting to apply locks.
  * When a statement entered the queue.
  * When a statement exited the queue.
  * When a client has connected to an instance of **sqreamd** (if it reconnects).
  * When the log started executing.
  
Improved Presented License Information
************
SQream now displays information related to data size limitations, expiration date, type of license shown by the new UF. The **Utility Function (UF)** name is ``get_license_info()``.

For more information, see `GET_LICENSE_INFO <https://docs.sqream.com/en/v2021.1/reference/sql/sql_statements/utility_commands/get_license_info.html>`_.


  

Optimized Foreign Data Wrapper Export
************
Sqream now supports exporting to multiple files concurrently. This is useful when you need to reduce file size to more easily export multiple files.

The following is the correct syntax for exporting multiple files concurrently:

.. code-block:: none

   COPY table_name TO fdw_name OPTIONS(max_file_size=size_in_bytes,enforce_single_file={TRUE|FALSE});
   
The following is an example of the correct syntax for exporting multiple files concurrently:

.. code-block:: none

   COPY my_table1 TO my_ext_table OPTIONS(max_file_size=500000,enforce_single_file=TRUE);

The following apply:

* Both of the parameters in the above example are optional.

* The ``max_file_size`` value is specified in bytes and can be any positive value. The default value is ``16*2^20`` (16MB).

* When the ``enforce_single_file`` value is set to ``TRUE``, only one file is created, and its size is not limited by the ``max_file_size`` value. Its default value is ``TRUE``.

Main Features
--------
The following list describes the main features:

* SQreamDB available on AWS.
* SQreamDB available on GCP.
* SQreamDB available on Azure.
* SQream usages storage located on Object Store (as opposed to local disks) for the above three cloud providers.
* SQream now supports Microstrategy.
* Supports MVP licensing system.
* A new literal syntax containing character escape semantics for string literals has been added.
* Supports optimizing exporting foreign data wrappers.
* Supports truncating Numeric values when ingested from ORC and CSV files.
* Supports catalog Utility Function that accepts valid SQL patterns and escape characters.
* Supports creating a basic random data foreign data wrapper for non-text types.
* The new foreign data wrapper ``random_fdw`` has been introduced for non-text types.
* Supports simple scalar SQL UDF's.
* SQream parses its own logs as CSV's.


Resolved Issues
---------
The following list describes the resolved issues:

* Copying text from a CSV file to the TEXT column without closing quotes caused SQream to crash. This was fixed.
* Using an unsupported function call generated an incorrect insert error. This was fixed. 
* Using the ``insert into`` function from ``table_does_not_exist`` generated an incorrect error.
* SQream treated inserting ``*`` in ``select_distinct`` as one column. This was fixed.
* Using certain encodeKey functions generated errors. This was fixed.
* Compile errors occurred while running decimal datatype sets. This was fixed.
* Running the ``select table_name,row_count from sqream_catalog.tables order by row_count limit 5`` query generated an internal runtime error.
* Using wildcards (such as ``*.x.y``) did not work in parquet files. This was fixed.
* Executing ``log*(x,y)`` generated an incorrect error message. This was fixed.
* The ``internal runtime error`` type doesn't have a fixed size when doing max on text on develop.
* The ``min`` and ``max`` on ``TEXT`` were significantly slower than ``varchar``. This was fixed.
* Running ``regexp_instr`` generated an empty regular expression. This was fixed.
* Schemas with foreign tables could be dropped. This was fixed.





	



Operations and Configuration Changes
--------
Recommended SQream Configuration on Cloud
************

For more information about AWS, see `Amazon S3 <https://docs.sqream.com/en/v2021.1/operational_guides/s3.html>`_.




Optimized Foreign Data Wrapper Export Configuration Flag
************

SQream now has a new ``runtimeGlobalFlags`` flag called ``WriteToFileThreads``.

This flag configures the number of threads in the **WriteToFile** function. The default value is ``16``.

For more information about the ``runtimeGlobalFlags`` flag, see the **Runtime Global Flags** table in `Configuration <https://docs.sqream.com/en/v2021.1/configuration_guides/index.html>`_.




Naming Changes
-------
No relevant naming changes were made.

Deprecated Features
-------
No features were depecrated.

Known Issues and Limitations
--------
The the list below describes the following known issues and limitations:

* In cases when selecting top 1 from foreign table using the Parquet format with an hdfs path, SQream experienced an error.
* Internal Runtime Error occurred when SQream was unable to find column in reorder columns.
* Casting datetime to text truncates the time segment.
* In the **select** list, the compiler generates an error when a count is used as an alias.	
* Performance degradation occurred when joins made on small tables.
* SQream causes a logging error when using copy from logs.
* Deploying S3 requires setting the ``ObjectStoreClients`` parameter to ``40``.

Upgrading to v2021.1
-------
Due to the known issue of a limitation on the amount of access requests that can be simultaneously sent to AWS, deploying S3 requires setting the ``ObjectStoreClients`` parameter to ``40``.
