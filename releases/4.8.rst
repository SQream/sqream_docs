New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------



► Prepared statements, also known as parameterized queries, are a safer and more efficient way to execute SQL statements. They prevent SQL injection attacks by separating SQL code from data, and they can improve performance by reusing prepared statements.
These are now supported by our `Python <../connecting_to_sqream/client_drivers/python/index.html#prepared-statements>`_ and `JDBC <../connecting_to_sqream/client_drivers/jdbc/index.html#prepared-statements>`_ client drivers.

► `PIVOT <../reference/sql/sql_syntax/pivot_unpivot.html#syntax>`_ allows to convert row-level data into columnar representation. This technique is particularly useful when you need to summarize and visualize data. `UNPIVOT <../reference/sql/sql_syntax/pivot_unpivot.html#syntax>`_ does the opposite by transforming columnar data into rows. This operation is invaluable for scenarios where you wish to explore data in a more granular manner.

► `Window funtion alias  <../reference/sql/sql_syntax/window_functions.html#window-funtion-alias>`_ allows to specify a parameter within the window function definition. This eliminates the need to repeatedly input the same SQL code in queries that use multiple window functions with identical definitions.

► `CONCAT <../reference/sql/sql_functions/scalar_functions/string/concat_function.html#concat-function>`_ function concatenates one or more strings, or concatenates one or more binary values.


Known Issues

:ref:`Percentile<percentile_disc>` is not supported for :ref:`Window Functions<window_functions>`

Deprecations
-------------------

► **Haskell CLI**

Starting October 2024, support for the Haskell CLI will be discontinued, and it will be replaced by a JAVA CLI that is compatible with both SQreamDB and BLUE.

► **CentOS Linux 7.x**

* As of June 2024, CentOS Linux 7.x will reach its End of Life and will not be supported by SQreamDB. This announcement provides a one-year advance notice for our users to plan for this change. We recommend users to explore migration or upgrade options to maintain ongoing support and security beyond this date. 

* REHL 8.x is now officially supported.

Upgrading to Version 4.8
-------------------------

1. Generate a back-up of the metadata by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      select backup_metadata('out_path');
	  
   .. tip:: SQreamDB recommends storing the generated back-up locally in case needed.
   
   SQreamDB runs the Garbage Collector and creates a clean backup tarball package.
   
2. Shut down all SQreamDB services.

3. Copy the recently created back-up file.

4. Replace your current metadata with the metadata you stored in the back-up file.

5. Navigate to the new SQreamDB package bin folder.

6. Run the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      ./upgrade_storage <levelDB path>
	


  .. note:: Upgrading from a major version to another major version requires you to follow the **Upgrade Storage** step. This is described in Step 7 of the `Upgrading SQreamDB Version <../installation_guides/installing_sqream_with_binary.html#upgrading-sqream-version>`_ procedure.
