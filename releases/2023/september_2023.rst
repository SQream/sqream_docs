New Features

Resource Availability Status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Easily follow the number of Workers available for new queries by glancing at the **Resource Availability Status** at the top of the page. 

* The **Resource Availability Status** shows how many Workers are currently working on executed queries
* A green dot at the left of the bar indicates that your cluster is active, with one or more Workers up and running, while a red dot indicates that your cluster is suspended
* Hovering over the status bar reveals information about your cluster, including your current Worker package size, the number of Workers allocated to each of your resource pools, and which pool is currently active

Jobs Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The BLUE :ref:`Jobs<performing_basic_blue_operations>` workflow management tool has been added an authentication layer that requires you to generate an access token and define a **Blue Jobs** connection.
