New Features and Enhancements
-------------------------------

Apache Calcite Compiler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

BLUE now uses the Apache Calcite framework, leveraging its SQL parser and validator to ensure accurate interpretation and validation of SQL queries. With its robust relational algebra representation, Calcite internally transforms queries into a structured algebraic form, enhancing the efficiency of query optimization and plan manipulation within BLUE.

Sharing Jobs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You're now able to share your Jobs with specific team members, giving them deletion, duplication, and sharing permissions. This feature comes in handy when you're looking to streamline your workflow and expand on existing projects. Additionally, you can make your Jobs public, allowing everyone in your cluster to view your work and have the same deletion, duplication, and sharing permissions.

Console Table View
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When working with BLUE console, you now have the capability to query data with a table view, offering several advantages. Firstly, it enhances the readability and organization of data. Instead of a continuous stream of text, a table format presents information in a structured manner, making it easier for users to comprehend. Secondly, tables provide a visual representation of data, making it more accessible for users who are accustomed to graphical interfaces. Additionally, a table view often includes column headers, allowing users to quickly identify and understand the different attributes or parameters associated with the data.
