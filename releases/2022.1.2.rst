Automatic Foreign Table DDL Resolution
************
When mapping external files to foreign tables, SQream now automatically identifies the required schema. This is especially useful for Parquet files, which include built-in schema declarations. 

For more information, see :ref:`automatic_foreign_table_ddl_resolution`.
   
Enhanced Automatic Adaptive Compression
************
SQream's automatic adaptive compression has been enhanced with new compression methods. This mechanism automatically uses the best compression method for each scenario, improving the compression ratio by approximately twice of that in Version 2022.1

.. note:: The compression ratio depends on the nature of the compressed data and on other variables, such as ordering, cardinality and data types.

For more information, navigate to the **Compression Methods** table on the :ref:`compression` page.

Upgrading to v2022.1.2
-------
1. Generate a back-up of the metadata by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ select backup_metadata('out_path');
	  
   .. tip:: SQream recommends storing the generated back-up locally in case needed.
   
   SQream runs the Garbage Collector and creates a clean backup tarball package.
   
2. Shut down all SQream services.

    ::

3. Extract the recently created back-up file.

    ::

4. Replace your current metadata with the metadata you stored in the back-up file.

    ::

5. Navigate to the new SQream package bin folder.

    ::

6. Run the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ ./upgrade_storage <levelDB path>

  .. note:: Upgrading from a major version to another major version requires you to follow the **Upgrade Storage** step. This is described in Step 7 of the `Upgrading SQream Version <https://docs.sqream.com/en/v2022.1.2/installation_guides/installing_sqream_with_binary.html#upgrading-sqream-version>`_ procedure.
