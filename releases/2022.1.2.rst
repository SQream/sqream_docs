Upgrading to v2022.1.2
-------
1. Generate a back-up of the metadata by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ select backup_metadata('out_path');
	  
   .. tip:: SQream recommends storing the generated back-up locally in case needed.
   
   SQream runs the Garbage Collector and creates a clean backup tarball package.
   
2. Shut down all SQream services.


3. Extract the recently created back-up file.


4. Replace your current metadata with the metadata you stored in the back-up file.


5. Navigate to the new SQream package bin folder.


6. Run the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ ./upgrade_storage <levelDB path>

  .. note:: Upgrading from a major version to another major version requires you to follow the **Upgrade Storage** step. This is described in Step 7 of the `Upgrading SQream Version <https://docs.sqream.com/en/v2022.1.2/installation_guides/installing_sqream_with_binary.html#upgrading-sqream-version>`_ procedure.
