Resolved Issues
-------------
The following list describes the resolved issues:

* SQream did not support exporting and reading **Int64** columns as **bigint** in Parquet. This was fixed.
* The Decimal column was not supported when inserting data from Parquet files. This was fixed.
* Values in Parquet Numeric columns were not being converted correctly. This was fixed.
* Converting ``string`` data type to ``datetime`` was not working correctly. This was fixed.
* Casting ``datetime`` to ``text`` truncated the time. This was fixed.
