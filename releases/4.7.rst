New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------

► You may now use the new ``logFormat`` flag to configure the format of your log files. By default, logs are saved as ``CSV`` files. To configure your log files to be saved as ``JSON`` instead, use the ``logFormat`` flag in your :ref:`legacy config file<current_method_flag_types>`. If your current logs are in ``CSV`` format and you require Health Monitoring, it's advisable to configure your logs to be saved in both ``CSV`` and ``JSON`` formats as outlined above.

.. note::

	The ``logFormat`` flag must be configured identically in both your legacy_config_file and your metadata_config_file

► You may now retrieve and manipulate data from different databases within a single SQreamDB cluster through the execution of a single SQL statement using the :ref:`Cross-Database<cross_database_query>` syntax.


► SQreamDB operates with utmost efficiency when processing tables containing large data chunks. Introducing a new :ref:`rechunk` utility function, it simplifies the management of tables with small data chunks. This feature enables users to merge small data chunks into larger ones and simultaneously eliminating any deleted records present.

► Enable automatic termination of queries that exceed a pre-defined time limit in the queue. The introduction of the :ref:`queueTimeoutMinutes <current_method_configuration_levels>` flag empowers you to set time constraints for queries in the queue, ranging from a few minutes to a maximum of 72 hours.

► JDBC enhancements have been implemented to facilitate the retrieval of the record count for the updated number of rows during ``INSERT`` and ``DELETE`` operations when connecting to a third-party platform via JDBC. Use the SQreamDB JDBC connector as usual; the sole distinction is in the ability to now observe the updated number of rows.

► Enhance your :ref:`COPY FROM<copy_from>` operations with the new ``DELETE_SOURCE_ON_SUCCESS`` parameter, which automatically deletes the source file being copied into SQreamDB. This not only saves time and effort in cleaning storage but also helps conserve storage space.



► :ref:`health_monitoring`

► Safely cast data types with the new :ref:`IsCastable<is_castable>` function. This function allows you to check whether a cast operation is possible or supported for a given column and data type and provides an alternative when an exception occurs when used within a ``CASE`` statement.

► Multi-platform CLI 

► You now have the option to choose the location for your ``metadata_server``, ``server_picker``, and Worker log files. In previous SQreamDB versions, the location of your log files was predetermined and hard-coded.

:ref:`metadata_server_cli_reference`

* Using the ``metadata_server_config.json`` file:

  .. code-block:: json 

	{
	"logPath": "<home/logs/my_logs>" 
	}
	
* Using the CLI:

  .. code-block:: console

	./metadata_server --log_path=<home/logs/my_logs>
	
:ref:`server_picker_cli_reference`

  Using the CLI:

  .. code-block:: console

	./server_picker --log_path=<home/logs/my_logs>

:ref:`Worker<current_method_modification_methods>`

  Using the ``sqream_config_legacy.json``:

  .. code-block:: json

	{
	"DefaultPathToLogs": "<home/logs/my_logs>"
	}

------------

* :ref:`Percentile<percentile_disc>` is not supported for :ref:`Window Functions<window_functions>`

Deprecations
-------------------

► **Haskell CLI**

Starting October 2024, support for the Haskell CLI will be discontinued, and it will be replaced by a JAVA CLI that is compatible with both SQreamDB and BLUE.

► **CentOS Linux 7.x**

* As of June 2024, CentOS Linux 7.x will reach its End of Life and will not be supported by SQreamDB. This announcement provides a one-year advance notice for our users to plan for this change. We recommend users to explore migration or upgrade options to maintain ongoing support and security beyond this date. 

* REHL 8.x is now officially supported.

Upgrading to Version 4.7
-------------------------

1. Generate a back-up of the metadata by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      select backup_metadata('out_path');
	  
   .. tip:: SQreamDB recommends storing the generated back-up locally in case needed.
   
   SQreamDB runs the Garbage Collector and creates a clean backup tarball package.
   
2. Shut down all SQreamDB services.

3. Copy the recently created back-up file.

4. Replace your current metadata with the metadata you stored in the back-up file.

5. Navigate to the new SQreamDB package bin folder.

6. Run the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      ./upgrade_storage <levelDB path>
	
7. Version 4.4 introduces a service permission feature that enables superusers to grant and revoke role access to services. However, when upgrading from version 4.2 or earlier to version 4.4 or later, this feature initializes access to services, causing existing roles to lose their access to services. 

There are two methods of granting back access to services:

   * Grant access to all services for all roles using the :ref:`grant_usage_on_service_to_all_roles` utility function
   * Selectively grant or revoke access to services by following the :ref:`access permission guide<access_control_permissions>`


  .. note:: Upgrading from a major version to another major version requires you to follow the **Upgrade Storage** step. This is described in Step 7 of the `Upgrading SQreamDB Version <../installation_guides/installing_sqream_with_binary.html#upgrading-sqream-version>`_ procedure.
