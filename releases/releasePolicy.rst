Release Cadence
===============
New product versions will be released as per the established product roadmap or when significant features, improvements, or bug fixes are ready for deployment.


Transition to Maintenance Mode
==============================
Upon release of a new version, the previous version immediately transitions into Maintenance Mode.
During Maintenance Mode supported would be limited to high-priority issues and showstopper bugs that impact critical functionality.

End of Support Timeline
=======================
End of Support (EOS) for each version is scheduled one year after the version's release date.
After the EOS date, no further updates or bug fixes will be provided for that version, and customers will be encouraged to upgrade to a supported version to receive continued updates and support.
