What's new in 2021.2
**************************

* 24 bugs fixed.
* Major performance enhancements.

Performance Enhancements
=========================
* Major feature release targeted for all on-premises customers.

* Includes basic Cloud functionality.

* Supports ``numeric(p, s)`` numeric data types where ``p`` is the total number of digits, (``38`` maximum), and ``s`` is the total number of decimal digits.

Example:
   
   .. code-block:: none
      
      create or replace table t(x numeric(20, 10), y numeric(38, 38));
      insert into t values(1234567890.1234567890, 0.123245678901234567890123456789012345678);
      select x + y from t;

* **Question: Should this bullet be included in Known Issues and Limitations below?** Does not support Numeric Literal operations and known issues.

* Supports the following types:

   * All join types
   * All aggregation types
   * Scalar functions **(waiting for the list of limitations)**

* Text data type major bug fixes and functionality enhancement:

   * Support text columns in queries with multiple distinct aggregates.
   * Text literal support for all functions
   * Use LoopJoin rather than CrossJoin for join on Text keys


Example:
   
   .. code-block:: none
      
      create or replace table t(x numeric(20, 10), y numeric(38, 38));
      insert into t values(1234567890.1234567890, 0.123245678901234567890123456789012345678);
      select x + y from t;
