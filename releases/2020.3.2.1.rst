.. _2021.2:

**************************
What's new in 2021.2
**************************

* 24 bugs fixed.
* Major performance enhancements.

Performance Enhancements
=========================
* Major feature release targeted for all on-premises customers.
* Includes basic Cloud functionality.

New Features
=========================


* Supports ``numeric(p, s)`` numeric data types where ``p`` is the total number of digits, (``38`` maximum), and ``s`` is the total number of decimal digits.
* **Question: I think each bullet below should be set off as its own section to make the document look more organized, because the example breaks the flow.**



Example:
   
   .. code-block:: none
      
      create or replace table t(x numeric(20, 10), y numeric(38, 38));
      insert into t values(1234567890.1234567890, 0.123245678901234567890123456789012345678);
      select x + y from t;

* Question: Should this bullet be included in Known Issues and Limitations below? Does not support Numeric Literal operations and known issues.

* Supports the following types:

   * All join types
   * All aggregation types
   * Scalar functions **(waiting for the list of limitations)**

* Text data type major bug fixes and functionality enhancements:

   * Question: Which of the following are bug fixes and which are functionality enhancements?)
   * Support text columns in queries with multiple distinct aggregates.
   * Text literal support for all functions.
   * Use LoopJoin instead of CrossJoin for join on Text keys.
    

* Supports Partial Sub-Queries.

See `currently supported functionality <https://sqream.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RF/pages/1433894919/Sub-Queries+support+and+limitations+in+SQream+DB+v2021.1>`_.
Question: if this is a new feature, why is there existing documentation? Is this actually an enhancement, or really a new feature?

* Literal arguments are now supported in all cases where column arguments are supported for a certain function. Literal arguments are only supported if the Literal value is  the same TYPE as the column.

* Supports Simple Scalar SQL UDFs.
See `supported syntax and usage <https://sqream.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RF/pages/1433731135/Simple+Scalar+SQL+UDF+s>`_.
