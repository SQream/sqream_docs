Deprecated Features
-------------------

► Square Brackets ``[]``

The ``[]``, which are frequently used to delimit :ref:`identifiers<keywords_and_identifiers>` such as column names, table names, and other database objects, will soon be deprecated to facilitate the use of the ``ARRAY`` data type.

* Support in ``[]`` for delimiting database object identifiers ends on June 1st, 2023.

* To delimit database object identifiers, you will be able to use double quotes ``""``.


► ``VARCHAR``

The ``VARCHAR`` data type is deprecated to improve the core functionalities of the platform and to align with the constantly evolving ecosystem requirements.

* Support in the ``VARCHAR`` data type ends at September 30th, 2023.

* ``VARCHAR`` is no longer supported for new customers, effective from Version 2022.1.3.  

* The ``TEXT`` data type is replacing the ``VARCHAR`` and ``NVARCHAR`` data types.




End of Support
--------------

No End of Support changes were made.

Upgrading to v4.1
-----------------

1. Generate a back-up of the metadata by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ select backup_metadata('out_path');
	  
   .. tip:: SQream recommends storing the generated back-up locally in case needed.
   
   SQream runs the Garbage Collector and creates a clean backup tarball package.
   
2. Shut down all SQream services.

3. Copy the recently created back-up file.

4. Replace your current metadata with the metadata you stored in the back-up file.

5. Navigate to the new SQream package bin folder.

6. Run the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ ./upgrade_storage <levelDB path>

  .. note:: Upgrading from a major version to another major version requires you to follow the **Upgrade Storage** step. This is described in Step 7 of the `Upgrading SQream Version <../installation_guides/installing_sqream_with_binary.html#upgrading-sqream-version>`_ procedure.
