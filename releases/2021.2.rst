Centralized Configuration System

For more information, see the following:

* `Configuration <https://docs.sqream.com/en/v2021.2/guides/operations/configuration.html>`_ - describes how to configure your instance of SQream from a centralized location.
* `SQream Studio 5.4.2 <https://docs.sqream.com/en/v2021.2/guides/operations/sqream_studio_5.4.2.html#>`_ - configure your instance of SQream from Studio.
   
Qualifying Schemas Without Providing an Alias
************
When running queries, SQream now supports qualifying schemas without providing an alias.

For more information, see :ref:`create_schema`.





Double-Quotations Supported When Importing and Exporting CSVs
************
When importing and exporting CSVs, SQream now supports using quotation characters other than double quotation marks (``"``).

For more information, see the following:

* :ref:`copy_from`

* :ref:`copy_to`


Note the following:

* Leaving *<x>* unspecified uses the default value of standard double quotations ``‚Äù``.

   ::

* The quotation character must be a single, 1-byte printable ASCII character. The same octal syntax of the copy command can be used.

   ::

* The quote character cannot be contained in the field delimiter, record delimiter, or null marker.

   ::
   
* Double-quotations can be customized when the ``csv_fdw`` value is used with the ``COPY FROM`` and ``CREATE FOREIGN TABLE`` statements.

   ::

* The default escape character always matches the quote character, and can be overridden by using the ``ESCAPE = {'\\' | E'\XXX')`` syntax as shown in the following examples:

  .. code-block:: postgres

     copy t from wrapper csv_fdw options (location = '/tmp/file.csv', escape='\\');

  .. code-block:: postgres

     copy t from wrapper csv_fdw options (location = '/tmp/file.csv', escape=E'\017');

  .. code-block:: postgres

     copy t to wrapper csv_fdw options (location = '/tmp/file.csv', escape='\\');
	 
For more information, see the following statements:


* :ref:`copy_from`

* :ref:`create_foreign_table`
