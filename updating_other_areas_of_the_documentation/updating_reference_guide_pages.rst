Updating Reference Guide Pages
***********************
When new statements or functions are added, you must document them in the **Reference Guides** section, which includes the following sub-sections:

* **SQL Syntax Features:**

  * Identifiers
  * Literals
  * Scalar expressions
  * Joins
  * Common table expressions (CTEs)
  * Window Functions
  * Subqueries
  * Null handling

     ::

* **SQL Statements:**

  * Data Definition Commands (DDL)
  * Data Manipulation Commands (DML)
  * Utility Commands
  * Workload Management
  * Access Control Commands

     ::

* **SQL Functions:**

  * Built-In Scalar Functions
  * User-Defined Scalar Functions
  * Aggregate Functions
  * Window Functions
  * Workload Management Functions

When a new syntax feature, statement, or function is developed, you must determine the correct place to document it in the topic menu above. In some cases the statement or function is associated with a particular feature. In such a case you must also either create a new Feature Guides page, or update an existing one. While you are becoming familiar with the SQream product, the **Product** team can help you determine where to document new features, statements, or functions.
