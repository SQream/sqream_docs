Who Reviews My Work?
***********************
Generally speaking, the person responsible for reviewing your work depends on who wrote it, its SQream team, and its scope.

When you document a feature based on a **Product Requirement Document (PRD)**, the person who wrote the PRD is typically responsible for reviewing it. However, if the feature was developed by R&D, for example, somebody in R&D should review it. You can search for all internal documentation, including PRDs, from SQream's `Confluence <https://sqream.atlassian.net/wiki/home>`_ platform.

A good way to submit your work for review is to convert the build page to PDF, upload it to Google Drive, and share it with the required contacts. Make sure to ask the recipients to see your comments and leave their own. Once reviewed and commented, you can integrate their comments into the document and publish it.

The following are the general guidelines on your points of contact:

* **Installation guides** - Slavi Khodorkovsky

   ::

* **Connecting to SQream** - Yotam Steinberg

   ::

* **Configuration guides** - Eilon Levine

If you have any questions about who should review the different types of documentation you write and work on, speak with Ben Esh, the **Product Manager**.
