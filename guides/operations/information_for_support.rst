If comfortable, attach as many of the following:

SQream support may have additional questions or requests, based on the information provided.

How SQream debugs issues
===================================

Reproduce
--------------

To debug most issues, we need to reproduce the problem. Some problems are repeatable, and can be repdroduced even without accessing the problematic database.

Reproducing an issue consists of understanding:

#. What was SQream DB doing at the time?
#. How is the SQream DB cluster configured?
#. How does the schema look?
#. What is the query or statement that exposed the problem?
#. Were there any external factors? (e.g. Network disconnection, hardware failure, etc.)

Logs
--------

The logs produced by SQream DB contain a lot of information that may be useful for debugging.

Look for error messages in the log. SQream's support staff are experienced in correlating logs to workloads, and finding possible problems.

Fix
---------

Once the issue is reproduced, it can be fixed.

A fix can be issued as a hotfix to an existing version, or as part of a bigger major release.

Your SQream account manager will keep you up-to-date about the status of the problem reported.
