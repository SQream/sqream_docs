Metadata system

show the metadata system in action:
describe a scenario
show a statement which is accelerated via the metadata system
do this for a bunch of variants

* where
* count
* delete support

collects size, and min and max metadata per chunk and extent, for
every column

can easily skip reading chunks and extents when running statements
with the right shape

this is cheap to do, and cheap to store, and it is always on
