   :alt: SQream DB internals

start with the architecture from the cmu lecture

describe the concepts behind the storage, transaction, statement
engine

talk about columnar

talk about gpus

some of this might be better in another document, if you're reading to
understand how sqream performs, this is not the internal architecture
but something more directly important to a customer/user
