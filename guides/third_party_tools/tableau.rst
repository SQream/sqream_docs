Installing the JDBC Driver Manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you are using MacOS, Linux, or the Tableau server, after installing the Tableau Desktop application you can install the JDBC driver manually. When the driver is installed, you can connect to SQream.

**To install the JDBC driver manually:**

1. Download the JDBC installer and SQream Tableau connector (.taco) file from the :ref:`from the client drivers page<client_drivers>`.

    ::

#. Install the JDBC driver by unzipping the JDBC driver into a Tableau driver directory.
   
   Based on the installation method that you used, your Tableau driver directory is located in one of the following places:

   * **Tableau Desktop on Windows:** *C:\\Program Files\\Tableau\\Drivers*
   * **Tableau Desktop on MacOS:** *~/Library/Tableau/Drivers*
   * **Tableau on Linux**: */opt/tableau/tableau_driver/jdbc*
	  
.. note:: If the driver includes only a single .jar file, copy it to *C:\\Program Files\\Tableau/Drivers*. If the driver includes multiple files, create a subfolder *A* in *C:\\Program Files\\Tableau/Drivers* and copy all files to folder *A*.

Note the following when installing the JDBC driver:

* You must have read permissions on the .jar file.
* Tableau requires a JDBC 4.0 or later driver.
* Tableau requires a Type 4 JDBC driver.
* The latest 64-bit version of Java 8 is installed.

3. Install the **SQreamDB.taco** file by moving the SQreamDB.taco file into the Tableau connectors directory.
   
   Based on the installation method that you used, your Tableau driver directory is located in one of the following places:

   * **Tableau Desktop on Windows:** *C:\\Users\\<your user>\\My Tableau Repository\\Connectors*
   * **Tableau Desktop on Windows:** *~/My Tableau Repository/Connectors*
   
      ::
	  
4. *Optional* - If you are using the Tableau Server, do the following:
   
   1. Create a directory for Tableau connectors and give it a descriptive name, such as *C:\\tableau_connectors*.
      
      This directory needs to exist on all Tableau servers.
      
       ::
   
   2. Copy the SQreamDB.taco file into the new directory.
   
       ::
   
   3. Set the **native_api.connect_plugins_path** option to ``tsm`` as shown in the following example:

      .. code-block:: console
   
         $ tsm configuration set -k native_api.connect_plugins_path -v C:/tableau_connectors
      
      If a configuration error is displayed, add ``--force-keys`` to the end of the command as shown in the following example:

      .. code-block:: console
   
         $ tsm configuration set -k native_api.connect_plugins_path -v C:/tableau_connectors--force-keys
		 
   4. To apply the pending configuration changes, run the following command:

      .. code-block:: console
    
         $ tsm pending-changes apply
      
      .. warning:: This restarts the server.

You can now restart Tableau Desktop or Server to begin using the SQream driver by :ref:`connecting to SQream <tableau_connect_to_sqream>` as described in the section below.

   :local:

.. note:: SQream recommends installing the JDBC driver to provide improved connectivity.

Automatically Reconfiguring the ODBC Driver After Initial Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you've already installed the SQream ODBC driver and installed Tableau, SQream recommends reinstalling the ODBC driver with the **.TDC Tableau Settings for SQream DB** configuration shown in the image below:

.. image:: /_static/images/odbc_windows_installer_tableau.png

SQream recommends this configuration because Tableau creates temporary tables and runs several discovery queries that may impact performance. The ODBC driver installer avoids this by automatically reconfiguring Tableau.

For more information about reinstalling the ODBC driver installer, see :ref:`Install and Configure ODBC on Windows <install_odbc_windows>`.

If you want to manually reconfigure the ODBC driver, see :ref:`Manually Reconfiguring the ODBC Driver After Initial Installation <manually_reconfigure_odbc_driver>` below.

.. _manually_reconfigure_odbc_driver:

Manually Reconfiguring the ODBC Driver After Initial Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The file **Tableau Datasource Customization (TDC)** file lets you use Tableau make full use of SQream DB's features and capabilities.

**To manually reconfigure the ODBC driver after initial installation:**

1. Do one of the following:

   1. Download the :download:`odbc-sqream.tdc <odbc-sqream.tdc>` file to your machine and open it in a text editor.
   
       ::
   
   2. Copy the text below into a text editor:
   
   .. literalinclude:: odbc-sqream.tdc
      :language: xml
      :caption: SQream ODBC TDC File
      :emphasize-lines: 2

#. Check which version of Tableau you are using.

    ::

#. In the text of the file shown above, in the highlighted line, replace the version number with the **major** version of Tableau that you are using.

   For example, if you are using Tableau vesion **2019.2.1**, replace it with **2019.2**.

    ::

#. Do one of the following:

   * If you are using **Tableau Desktop** - save the TDC file to *C:\\Users\\<user name>\\Documents\\My Tableau Repository\\Datasources*, where ``<user name>`` is the Windows username that you have installed Tableau under.
 
    ::
	
   * If you are using the **Tableau Server** - save the TDC file to *C:\\ProgramData\\Tableau\\Tableau Server\\data\\tabsvc\\vizqlserver\\Datasources*.

Configuring the ODBC Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ODBC connection uses a DSN when connecting to ODBC data sources, and each DSN represents one SQream database.

**To configure the ODBC connection:**

1. Create an ODBC DSN.

    ::

#. Open the Windows menu by pressing the Windows button (:kbd:`âŠž Win`) or clicking the **Windows** menu button.

    ::
	
#. Type **ODBC** and select **ODBC Data Sources (64-bit)**. 

   During installation, the installer created a sample user DSN named **SQreamDB**.
   
    ::
   
#. *Optional* - Do one or both of the following:

   * Modify the DSN name.
   
      ::
	 
   * Create a new DSN name by clicking **Add** and selecting **SQream ODBC Driver**.
   
.. image:: /_static/images/odbc_windows_dsns.png

Setting Up SQream Tables as Data Sources
----------------
After connecting to SQream you must set up the SQream tables as data sources.

**To set up SQream tables as data sources:**
	
1. From the **Table** menu, select the desired database and schema.

   SQream's default schema is **public**.
   
    ::
	
#. Drag the desired tables into the main area (labeled **Drag tables here**).

   This area is also used for specifying joins and data source filters.
   
    ::
	
#. Open a new sheet to analyze data. 

.. tip:: 
   For more information about configuring data sources, joining, filtering, see Tableau's `Set Up Data Sources <https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/datasource_prepare.htm>`_ tutorials.   

Tableau Best Practices and Troubleshooting
---------------
This section describes the following best practices and troubleshooting procedures when connecting to SQream using Tableau:

.. contents::
   :local:

Inserting Only Required Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When using Tableau, SQream recommends using only data that you need, as described below:

* Insert only the data sources you need into Tableau, excluding tables that don't require analysis.

   ::

* To increase query performance, add filters before analyzing. Every modification you make while analyzing data queries the SQream database, sometimes several times. Adding filters to the datasource before exploring limits the amount of data analyze and increases query performance.

Using Tableau's Table Query Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dragging your desired tables into the main area in Tableau builds queries based on its own syntax. This helps ensure increased performance, while using views or custom SQL may degrade performance. In addition, SQream recommends using the :ref:`create_view` to create pre-optimized views, which your datasources point to. 

Creating a Separate Service for Tableau
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SQream recommends creating a separate service for Tableau with the DWLM. This reduces the impact that Tableau has on other applications and processes, such as ETL. In addition, this works in conjunction with the load balancer to ensure good performance.

Troubleshooting Workbook Performance Before Deploying to the Tableau Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tableau has a built-in `performance recorder <https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/perf_record_create_desktop.htm>`_ that shows how time is being spent. If you're seeing slow performance, this could be the result of a misconfiguration such as setting concurrency too low.

Use the Tableau Performance Recorder for viewing the performance of queries run by Tableau. You can use this information to identify queries that can be optimized by using views.

Troubleshooting Error Codes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tableau may be unable to locate the SQream JDBC driver. The following message is displayed when Tableau cannot locate the driver:

.. code-block:: console
     
   Error Code: 37CE01A3, No suitable driver installed or the URL is incorrect
   
**To troubleshoot error codes:**

If Tableau cannot locate the SQream JDBC driver, do the following:

 1. Verify that the JDBC driver is located in the correct directory:
 
   * **Tableau Desktop on Windows:** *C:\Program Files\Tableau\Drivers*
   * **Tableau Desktop on MacOS:** *~/Library/Tableau/Drivers*
   * **Tableau on Linux**: */opt/tableau/tableau_driver/jdbc*
   
 2. Find the file path for the JDBC driver and add it to the Java classpath:
   
   * **For Linux** - ``export CLASSPATH=<absolute path of SQream DB JDBC driver>;$CLASSPATH``

        ::
		
   * **For Windows** - add an environment variable for the classpath:
 
	.. image:: /_static/images/third_party_connectors/tableau/envrionment_variable_for_classpath.png

If you experience issues after restarting Tableau, see the `SQream support portal <https://support.sqream.com>`_.
