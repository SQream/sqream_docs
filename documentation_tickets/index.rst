**Documentation tickets** are requests made by others for you to create, modify, remove, and/or correct some page in our documentation. You can (and should) also create tickets for yourself. 

When a ticket is created on your TPD board, it automatically enters your `Backlog <https://sqream.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/TPD/boards/101/backlog>`_.

The Backlog is your full list of documentation tickets. You can drag tickets up from your Backlog into the **Sprint** displayed above it. A Sprint is a work cycle, which I set to about three weeks. While it's recommended to try to synchronize your Sprints to the Development cycle set forth by the Development team, they often modify the version release date so it is not always possible.

When you drag a ticket up into a Sprint, it enters your **Board,** which is composed of the following item life cycle columns:

1. **TO DO** - Items that you've dragged into your Sprint and have not begun working on.

    ::

2. **IN PROGRESS** - Items that you've begun working on.

    ::

3. **REVIEW** - Items for which you've completed the first or second draft and have sent for review.

    ::

4. **DONE** - Items that you have completed, but have not published. This can apply to release notes content that you've completed, but are waiting until the release date to publish on live branches.

    ::

5. **INTEGRATION** - Items that you've published on live branches.
