Drafting Jobs
*************

Whether you're actively working on a Job for an extended duration or have initiated the composition without completion, you can choose to save it as a draft. If you navigate away without saving the Job manually, it will be automatically preserved in the **Jobs** > **Drafts** section. Only the creator of a draft can edit it.

1. In the sidebar, go to **Jobs**.
2. Select the **Create New Job** button, enter Job name, and select **Save**.

   The newly created Job page opens.
   
3. In the upper left corner, type in the task name and description.
4. Drag a script from the **Scripts** menu to the **Drag Script** box of the task.

   Ensure that your script is saved under your bucket parent directory or it will not show in the menu.

5. To create a task, select the |add_task| located under the last task in the **Preview** window.
6. You may now close the webpage you are working on and the Job will be automatically saved under **Jobs** > **Drafts**.
7. To edit a Job that is saved to **Drafts**, hover over a Job that you created, and from the |three_dot_job| menu choose **Edit Job**.
