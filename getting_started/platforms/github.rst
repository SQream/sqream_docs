**GitHub** is a versioning control software. While developers typically use it for keeping track of, and merging, code releases, it is ideal as well for release notes documentation. You can use GitHub remotely or locally, and while it's largely a matter of preference, I recommend using it locally.

For more information on how to use GitHub remotely and locally, see the following:
