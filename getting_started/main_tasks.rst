Writing Methodology
-----------------------
SQream documentation tends to be based on a granular approach, also known as **chunking**. This method breaks down content into smaller, more granular pages instead of large pages containing a lot of information.

One of your tasks is therefore to break large pages down into smaller chunks, such as `Data Encryption <https://docs.sqream.com/en/latest/feature_guides/data_encryption.html>`_, which initially contained all four sections on one page.

An example of a page that has not been reviewed as described above is `Concurrency and Locks <https://docs.sqream.com/en/latest/feature_guides/concurrency_and_locks.html>`_.

In addition, part of your responsibilities is to gradually review all documentation pages for readability, accuracy, structure, grammar, and general editing.
