Getting Started
***************

To start querying and analyzing your data, simply log in to the BLUE interface using your own Identity Provider (IDP) credentials. By leveraging Auth0, BLUE enables not only IDP authentication, but also multi-factor authentication, encryption, and anomaly detection to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. 

Log In
------

#. First, check your email for an invite from your administrator to join BLUE and follow the attachet link. 

#. Once you're in, select **Log In**. 

#. You will then be redirected to your IDP page, where you will need to verify your credentials. 
   This is a one-time process, after which you will be redirected back to the BLUE interface. 

From your second login onward, you will be automatically redirected to the BLUE interface.

Third-Party Tools
-----------------

Use the data analysis platform you're used to work with by :ref:`connecting to BLUE<connecting_to_blue>` using Python, JDBC, or ODBC.

Cost Management
---------------
To facilitate :ref:`cost management<cost_management>`, you have the option to use the suspension/resumption feature in your BLUE environment. This functionality allows you to temporarily pause the system and associated billing during periods when system usage is not required. You can subsequently resume the system as needed, ensuring flexibility and control over billing cycles.
