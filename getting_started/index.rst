Getting Started
***************

To start querying and analyzing your data, simply log in to the BLUE interface using your own Identity Provider (IDP) credentials. By leveraging Auth0, BLUE enables not only IDP authentication, but also multi-factor authentication, encryption, and anomaly detection to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. 

Login
-----

#. First, check your email for an invite from your administrator to join BLUE and follow the attachet link. 

#. Once you're in, select **Log In**. 

#. You will then be redirected to your IDP page, where you will need to verify your credentials. 
   This is a one-time process, after which you will be redirected back to the BLUE interface. 

From your second login onward, you will be automatically redirected to the BLUE interface.

Third-Party Tools
-----------------

Use the data analysis platform you're used to work with by :ref:`connecting to BLUE<connecting_to_blue>` using Python, JDBC, or ODBC.

Resource Management
-------------------

The :ref:`Resource Pool <managing_your_resources>` panel optimizes resource utilization in your BLUE environment. Reduce runtime during idle periods to manage costs and allocate workers based on department-specific needs for improved cluster utilization. Fine-tune worker allocation to maximize the benefits of your BLUE environment.
