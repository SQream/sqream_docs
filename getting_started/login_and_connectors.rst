Login and Connectors
*************************
BLUE supports the most common database tools and interfaces, giving you direct access through a variety of connectors, visualization tools, and utilities.

Log In Using the BLUE Interface
===============================

#. To log in to the BLUE interface, first, check your email for an invite from your administrator. 

#. Once you're in, select **Log In**. 

#. You will then be redirected to your Identity Provider (IDP) page, where you will need to verify your credentials. This is a one-time process. After you have verified your credentials, you will be redirected back to the BLUE interface. 

#. From your second login onward, you will be automatically redirected to the BLUE interface.

Connectors
==========
   
You may use any of the following connectors:

:ref:`JDBC <java_jdbc>`

:ref:`ODBC <odbc>`

:ref:`PySQream <pysqream>`


If you need a tool that BLUE does not currently support, contact our support team and we'll look into it.
