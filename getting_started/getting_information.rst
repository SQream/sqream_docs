This page describes how to get the source information you need to write your documentation.

The main sources of information are:

* **PRDs** - Product Requirement Documents are internal documents written by SMEs to describe features. You can find PRDs on our internal `Confluence <https://sqream.atlassian.net/wiki/home>`_ page.

     ::

* **Release notes pages** - Release notes pages are internal pages that describe the content of each release. For more information, see `Release Notes Master List <https://sqream.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/9928723/Release+Notes>`_.

     ::

* **SMEs** - SMEs can help you understand features and other areas of the documentation.

     ::

* **Library content** - Internal educational videos. For more information, see the `Library <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o2Fd08Cg8TmrSUk1GKojvQcg2g1gpvBq>`_.
