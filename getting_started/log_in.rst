BLUE leverages **Auth0** for authentication and authorization. This provides IDP authentication, Multi-Factor Authentication, encryption, and anomaly detection for protecting data and preventing unauthorized access. 

If this is your first login, follow this one-time authentication process after which you will be automatically redirected to the BLUE web interface.

Auth0 Identification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your organization uses Auth0, follow these steps for initial login.

#. Check your email for an Auth0 invite from your administrator to join BLUE and select **ACCEPT INVITATION**.

   An invitation window opens.
   
#. Select **Continue** and you will be logged in to BLUE.

From your second login onward, you will be automatically redirected to the BLUE interface.

Other Identity Provider Identification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your organization uses any other Identity Provider (IDP), follow these steps for initial login.

#. Follow the BLUE URL provided by your admin. 

#. Once you're in, select **Log In**. 

#. You will then be redirected to your IDP page, where you will need to verify your credentials. 
   This is a one-time process, after which you will be redirected back to the BLUE interface. 

From your second login onward, you will be automatically redirected to the BLUE interface.
