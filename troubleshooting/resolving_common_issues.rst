Connectivity Issues
-------------------

Connectivity issues can be caused by several factors, including incorrect login credentials, improper configurations, or network problems. The solution may be quick and simple, so to save invaluable querying time, we recommend checking for these potential issues before reaching out to customer support. By doing so, you can avoid unnecessary delays and get your connection up and running again in no time.

Verify that:

* You are using a valid access token

* The correct Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) is set

* Your internet connection is active

* Your connection to the BLUE system is not blocked and that you are able to log in to https://company.isqream.com. If not, reach out to your IT for support.

Query Performance
-----------------

Query performance can be influenced by various factors, including complex queries involving subqueries and joins, large data volumes, and network latency. To improve performance, refer to the :ref:`sql_best_practices` guide to learn how to optimize queries and table structure, and make sure that: 

* Table indexes are properly configured

* Queries are not unnecessarily overly complex

* Your system is not overloaded

* The database schema is properly designed 

Alternatively, you may also :ref:`retrieve the query execution plan output<retrieving_execution_plan_output_using_studio>` using your Workbench.

Query Behavior
--------------

Several factors can influence the behavior of SQL queries, including data inconsistencies, user permissions and access, and improper database configurations. To ensure that queries behave as expected, refer to the :ref:`sql` guide to learn about query syntax and optimization, and make sure that: 

* The data in your database in consistent

* The appropriate isolation level is set

* The proper concurrency mechanisms are used
