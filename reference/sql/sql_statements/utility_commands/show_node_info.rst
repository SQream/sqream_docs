********************
SHOW_NODE_INFO
********************

``SHOW_NODE_INFO`` returns a snapshot of the current query plan, similarly to the ``EXPLAIN ANALYZE`` function used in other databases.

The snapshot provides information about execution which can be used for monitoring and troubleshooting slow running statements by helping identify long-running execution nodes (components that process data), etc.

See also :ref:`explain`, :ref:`show_server_status`.

Permissions
=============

The role must have the ``SUPERUSER`` permissions.

Syntax
==========

.. code-block:: postgres

   show_node_info_statement ::=
       SELECT SHOW_NODE_INFO(stmt_id)
       ;
   
   stmt_id ::= bigint

Parameters
============

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``stmt_id``
     - The statement ID to explore

Returns
=========

This utility returns details of the execution nodes, if the statement is still running.

If the statement has finished, or the statment ID does not exist, the utility returns an empty result set.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f0] Gathers columns which should be returned. This node typically spends most of the time on decompressing additional columns.

.. [#f1] A GPU sort operation can be added by the statement compiler before ``GROUP BY`` or ``JOIN`` operations.

Notes
===========

* This utility shows the execution information for active statements. Once a query has finished execution, the information is no longer available using this utility. See :ref:`logging` for more information about extracting the information from the logs.

* This utility is primarily intended for troubleshooting with SQream support.
