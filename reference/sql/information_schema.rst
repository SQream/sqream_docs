Information Schema (SQream catalog)
####################################

SQream DB contains a virtual schema called ``sqream_catalog`` that contains information about your database's objects - tables, columns, views, permissions, and more.

Some additional catalog tables are used primarily for internal introspection, which could change across SQream DB versions.
