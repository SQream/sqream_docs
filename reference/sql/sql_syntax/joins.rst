Joins
*****

The ``JOIN`` clause combines results from two or more table expressions (tables, external tables, views) based on a related column or other condition. Performing a join outputs a new result set. For example, two tables containing one or more columns in common can be joined to match or correlate with rows from another table.

 


Syntax
======

The following shows the correct syntax for creating a **join**:

.. code-block:: postgres

   table_ref ::=
       | left_side join_type right_side
           [ ON value_expr ]
       | table_alias

   join_type ::=
       [ INNER ] [ join_hint ] JOIN
       | LEFT [ OUTER ] [ join_hint ] JOIN
       | RIGHT [ OUTER ] [ join_hint ] JOIN
       | CROSS [ join_hint ] JOIN

   join_hint ::=
       MERGE | LOOP

Join Types
----------

The **Join Types** section describes the following join types:
   
* :ref:`Inner joins<inner_joins>`
* :ref:`Left outer joins<left_outer_joins>`
* :ref:`Right outer joins<right_outer_joins>`
* :ref:`Cross joins<cross_joins>`

.. _inner_joins:

Inner Joins
^^^^^^^^^^^

The following shows the correct syntax for creating an **inner join**:

.. code-block:: postgres

   left_side [ INNER ] JOIN left_side ON value_expr


Inner joins are the default join type and return rows from the ``left_side`` and ``right_side`` based on a matching condition.

An inner join can also be specified by listing several tables in the ``FROM`` clause, as shown below:

.. code-block:: postgres

   FROM table1, table2
   [ { INNER JOIN
     | LEFT [OUTER] JOIN
     | RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN
   ON table1.column1 = table2.column1 ]

Omitting the ``ON`` or ``WHERE`` clause creates a ``CROSS JOIN``, where every ``left_side`` row is matched with every ``right_side`` row.

For more information about cross joins, see :ref:`cross joins<cross_joins>` below.

For an inner join example, see :ref:`Inner Join Example<inner_join_example>`.

.. _left_outer_joins:

Left Outer Joins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following shows the correct syntax for creating an **left outer join**:

.. code-block:: postgres

   left_side LEFT [ OUTER ] JOIN right_side ON value_expr

Left outer joins are similar to inner joins, except that for every ``left_side`` row without a matching condition, a ``NULL`` value is returned for the corresponding ``right_side`` column.

For a left inner join example, see :ref:`Left Join Example<left_join_example>`.


.. _right_outer_joins:

Right Outer Joins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following shows the correct syntax for creating an **right outer join**:

.. code-block:: postgres

   left_side RIGHT [ OUTER ] JOIN right_side ON value_expr

Right outer joins are similar to inner joins, except that for every ``right_side`` row without a matching condition, a ``NULL`` value is returned for the corresponding ``left_side`` column.

For a right outer join example, see :ref:`Right Join Example<right_join_example>`.


.. _cross_joins:

Cross Joins
^^^^^^^^^^^

The following shows the correct syntax for creating an **cross join**:

.. code-block:: postgres

   left_side CROSS JOIN right_side

Cross joins return all rows in all tables listed in a query, pairing each row in the first table with each row in the second table. A cross join is also known as a **Cartesian product**, and occurs when no relationship is defined between the two tables.

The ``CROSS JOIN`` clause cannot have an ``ON`` clause, but the ``WHERE`` clause can be used to limit the result set.

The following is an example of two tables that will be used as the basis for a cross join:

.. image:: /_static/images/color_table.png

The following is the output result of the cross join:

+-----------+-------------+
| **Color** | **Size**    |
+===========+=============+
| Red       | Small       |
+-----------+-------------+
| Blue      | Small       |
+-----------+-------------+
| Red       | Medium      |
+-----------+-------------+
| Blue      | Medium      |
+-----------+-------------+
| Red       | Large       |
+-----------+-------------+
| Blue      | Large       |
+-----------+-------------+
| Red       | Extra Large |
+-----------+-------------+
| Blue      | Extra Large |
+-----------+-------------+


For a cross join example, see :ref:`Cross Join Example<cross_join_example>`.





The ON Condition
----------------

The ``ON`` condition is a value expression that generates a Boolean output to identify whether rows match.

For example, the following is displayed when two name columns match:


.. code-block:: postgres

   ON left_side.name = right_side.name

The ``ON`` clause is optional for ``LEFT`` and ``RIGHT`` joins. However, excluding it results in a computationally intensive cross join.



Join Type Examples
==================

The examples in this section are based on a pair of tables with the following structure and content:

.. code-block:: postgres
   
   CREATE TABLE left_side (x INT);
   INSERT INTO left_side VALUES (1), (2), (4), (5);

   CREATE TABLE right_side (x INT);
   INSERT INTO right_side VALUES (2), (3), (4), (5), (6);

.. _inner_join_example:

Inner Join Example
------------------

The following is an example of an inner join.

.. code-block:: psql

   t=> SELECT * FROM left_side AS l JOIN right_side AS r 
   .          ON l.x = r.x;
   x | x0
   --+---
   2 |  2
   4 |  4
   5 |  5

Notice in the example above that values with no matching conditions do not appear in the result output.

.. _left_join_example:

Left Join Example
-----------------

The following is an example of a left join:

.. code-block:: psql

   t=> SELECT * FROM left_side AS l LEFT JOIN right_side AS r 
   .          ON l.x = r.x;
   x | x0
   --+---
   2 |  2
   4 |  4
   5 |  5
   1 | \N

.. note:: Note the unmatched``NULL`` (``\N``) values for ``1``. SQream outputs ``NULL`` values last.

.. _right_join_example:

Right Join Example
------------------

The following is an example of a right join:

.. code-block:: psql

   t=> SELECT * FROM left_side AS l RIGHT JOIN right_side AS r 
   .          ON l.x = r.x;
   x  | x0
   ---+---
   2  |  2
   4  |  4
   5  |  5
   \N |  3
   \N |  6

.. note:: Note the unmatched ``NULL`` values for ``3`` and ``6``. SQream outputs ``NULL`` values last. 

.. _cross_join_example:

Cross Join Example
------------------

The following is an example of a cross join:

.. code-block:: psql

   t=> SELECT * FROM left_side AS l CROSS JOIN right_side AS r;
   x | x0
   --+---
   1 |  2
   1 |  3
   1 |  4
   1 |  5
   1 |  6
   2 |  2
   2 |  3
   2 |  4
   2 |  5
   2 |  6
   4 |  2
   4 |  3
   4 |  4
   4 |  5
   4 |  6
   5 |  2
   5 |  3
   5 |  4
   5 |  5
   5 |  6

Specifying multiple comma-separated tables is equivalent to a cross join, which can be filtered with a ``WHERE`` clause as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: psql

   t=> SELECT * FROM left_side l, right_side r;
   x | x0
   --+---
   1 |  2
   1 |  3
   1 |  4
   1 |  5
   1 |  6
   2 |  2
   2 |  3
   2 |  4
   2 |  5
   2 |  6
   4 |  2
   4 |  3
   4 |  4
   4 |  5
   4 |  6
   5 |  2
   5 |  3
   5 |  4
   5 |  5
   5 |  6

   t=> SELECT * FROM left_side l, right_side r WHERE (r.x=l.x);
   x | x0
   --+---
   2 |  2
   4 |  4
   5 |  5

Join Hints
----------

**Join hints** can be used to override the query compiler and choose a particular join algorithm. The available algorithms are ``LOOP`` (corresponding to non-indexed nested loop join algorithm), and ``MERGE`` (corresponding to sort merge join algorithm). If no algorithm is specified, a loop join is performed by default.

The following is an example of using a join hint:

.. code-block:: psql
   
   t=> SELECT * FROM left_side AS l INNER MERGE JOIN right_side AS r  ON l.x = r.x;
   x | x0
   --+---
   2 |  2
   4 |  4
   5 |  5
   
   t=> SELECT * FROM left_side AS l INNER LOOP JOIN right_side AS r  ON l.x = r.x; 
   x | x0
   --+---
   2 |  2
   4 |  4
   5 |  5
