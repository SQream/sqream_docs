Why Are My Public Builds Failing?
***********************
Occasionally, a live build will fail when you try to publish it on Read-the-Docs.

The following are the main reasons for a failed build:

* You have tried to publish modifications on more than four branches at once. If this happens, cancel the fifth build, make a minor change on the corresponding branch, and recommit it.

   ::

* Read-the-Docs has updated an element of its sofware, which requires you to install or update your existing software. If this happens, contact the IT Manager, Slavi Khodorkovsky.
