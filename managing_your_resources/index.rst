Cluster Management
******************

You can optimize the utilization of your resources using the **Resource Pool** panel which enables you to manage your end-of-the-month cost by lowering runtime when your BLUE environment is idle and to enhance cluster utilization by allocating Workers according to the specific needs of different departments in your organization, whether it be high concurrency or performance.

All **Resource Pool** operations require a ``ClusterAdmin`` permission.
