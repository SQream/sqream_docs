Configuring a Monthly Spending Limit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can set and adjust a monthly spending limit at any time. The limit can be defined in any SGU amount, and both email and UI alerts will be triggered when the set limit is reached.

Additionally, you can configure email notifications to be sent when usage reaches a predefined percentage of the set limit. You can also add other cluster users to the email distribution list to receive these alerts.

Monitor Elements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To view the SGU monitor, in the side bar go to **Settings** > **Billing**.
