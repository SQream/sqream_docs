Why Are My Menu Items Disappearing?
***********************
If you've verified that your menu items are not disappearing due to the build file issue described in the previous section, verify the following:

 * That the file exists.

    ::

 * That the correct file is included in the ``toctree`` in both **index** files.

    ::

 * That the file name and anchor are identical.

    ::

 * That the file extension is **.rst** and not **.txt**.
