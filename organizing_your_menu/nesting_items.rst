How Do I Nest Menu Items?
***********************
You can nest menu items by inserting the ``toctree`` syntax  in an **index** file. The ``toctree`` syntax defines which existing pages (or sections, using a nested **index** file), will be displayed as submenu topic items.

For more information about nesting menu items, see :ref:`toc_tree`.
