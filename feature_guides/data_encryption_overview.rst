**Data Encryption** helps protect sensitive data by preventing unauthorized users from reading it in the event of a breach. This is achieved by scrambling the content into an unreadable format based on encryption and decryption keys.

The demand for confidentiality has steadily increased to protect the growing volumes of private data stored on computer systems and transmitted over the internet. To this end, regulatory bodies such as the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** have produced requirements to standardize and enforce compliance aimed at protecting customer data.

For more information on GDPR compliance requirements, see the `GDPR checklist <https://gdpr.eu/checklist/>`_.
