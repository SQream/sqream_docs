***********************
How Do I Document Known Issues?
***********************
**Known issues** are also known as **bugs**, and most version releases have them.

When you document a release's known issues you must only document **external**, or **public** bugs. Public bugs are those that the **Product** and **Development** team have decided should be exposed to the public in our release notes. Private bugs **cannot** be exposed to the public, either because they are irrelevant to our users, or worse, we **don't want them knowing about them**, such as if they are relevant only to a particular customer.

Each release notes version has its own internal page classifying all bugs as either **Public** or **Private**, defined in the **Documentation Scope** column.

**Known issues** are outstanding bugs that Development tries to resolve before a release date. As each bug is resolved the person working on it changes its status to **Resolved**. The only bugs that you should include on the release notes pages are those that are both **Public** and **Resolved**. Bugs that are not resolved are often rolled over to the next release.

If you need any help determining the status of bugs, speak with **Ben Esh**.
