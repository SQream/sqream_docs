Using Notepad
***********************
While you can use any documentation method you choose, I've found that **Notepad** and **Notepad++** are ideal for documentation, and each has its advantages and disadvantages.

**Notepad++** is good for creating documentation because it represents different types of syntax in different colors. In addition, it lets you navigate between folders and files in one application. One downside of Notepad++ is that it sometimes misaligns tables, bulleted lists, and numbered lists, which causes them to disappear from your page altogether.

**Notepad** is good for identifying and fixing the formatting issues above. Aside from the advantages described above, there aren't many practical differences between the two. The disadvantage of Notepad is that you must open a separate file for each page.
