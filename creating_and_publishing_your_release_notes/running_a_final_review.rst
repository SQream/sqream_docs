Running a Final Review
********************************************************
Reviewing all documentation on your new branch is the final step before duplicating the modifications to the Master branch and publishing them. During this page you want to briefly run through all documentation you created and/or updated, and follow all links to make sure that they work and direct to the correct location.

During this phase, make sure that the following are correct:

 * ``TOC`` and ``toctree`` syntax

     ::

 * As described in `Creating the Release Notes Page <https://docs.sqream.com/en/tech_doc_training/creating_and_publishing_your_release_notes/creating_the_release_notes_page.html#summarizing-the-release-version>`_, make sure that your release notes landing pages uses only absolute links, and not the ``:ref::`` syntax.

     ::

 * All links work and direct to the correct locations

     ::

 * Grammar and punctuation

Because your branch is still set to Private at this point, you can actually publish it and begin viewing it on the front end using the Private link.
