Creating a New Branch
********************************************************
When it's time to release a new version of SQream, you must create a new branch where you will document all new features. This is done by creating a new branch based on the previous branch.

**To create a new branch:**

1. From `GitHub remote <https://github.com/SQream/sqream_docs>`_, from the branch menu, select the most current branch (such as **v2022.1.1**).

     ::

2. Type a name for the new branch.

   The naming convention for branches is **vXXXX.X**, such as **v2022.1.2**. The new branch has been created and is identical to the branch you based it on.
