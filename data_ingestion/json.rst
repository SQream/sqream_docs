.. _json:****JSON****JSON (Java Script Object Notation) is used both as a file format and as a serialization method. The JSON file format is flexible and is commonly used for dynamic, nested, and semi-structured data representations. The SQream DB JSON parser supports the `RFC 8259 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259>`_ data interchange format and supports both JSON objects and JSON object arrays.Only the `JSON Lines <https://jsonlines.org/>`_ data format is supported by SQream... contents::    :local:   :depth: 1Foreign Data Wrapper Prerequisites===================================Before proceeding, ensure the following Foreign Data Wrapper (FDW) prerequisites:* **File Existence:** Verify that the file you are ingesting data from exists at the specified path.* **Path Accuracy:** Confirm that all path elements are present and correctly spelled. Any inaccuracies may lead to data retrieval issues.* **Bucket Access Permissions:** Ensure that you have the necessary access permissions to the bucket from which you are ingesting data. Lack of permissions can hinder the data retrieval process.* **Wildcard Accuracy:** If using wildcards, double-check their spelling and configuration. Misconfigured wildcards may result in unintended data ingestion.Making JSON Files Accessible to Workers=======================================To give workers access to files, every node in your system must have access to the storage being used.The following are required for JSON files to be accessible to workers:* For files hosted on NFS, ensure that the mount is accessible from all servers.* For HDFS, ensure that SQream servers have access to the HDFS NameNode with the correct **user-id**. For more information, see :ref:`hdfs`.* For S3, ensure network access to the S3 endpoint. For more information, see :ref:`s3`.For more information about configuring worker access, see :ref:`workload_manager`.Mapping between JSON and SQream===============================A JSON field consists of a key name and a value.Key names, which are case sensitive, are mapped to SQream columns. Key names which do not have corresponding SQream table columns are treated as errors by default, unless the ``IGNORE_EXTRA_FIELDS`` parameter is set to ``true``, in which case these key names will be ignored during the mapping process.SQream table columns which do not have corresponding JSON fields are automatically set to ``null`` as a value.Values may be one of the following reserved words (lower-case): ``false``, ``true``, or ``null``, or any of the following data types:.. list-table::    :widths: auto   :header-rows: 1      * - JSON Data Type     - Representation in SQream   * - Number     - ``TINYINT``, ``SMALLINT``, ``INT``, ``BIGINT``, ``FLOAT``, ``DOUBLE``, ``NUMERIC``   * - String     - ``TEXT``   * - JSON Literal     - ``NULL``, ``TRUE``, ``FALSE``   * - JSON Array     - ``TEXT``   * - JSON Object     - ``TEXT`` Character Escaping------------------The ASCII 10 character (LF) marks the end of JSON objects. Use ``\\n`` to escape the ``\n`` character when you do not mean it be a new line.Ingesting JSON Data into SQream===============================.. contents:: In this topic:   :local:Syntax-------To access JSON files, use the ``json_fdw`` with a ``COPY FROM``, ``COPY TO``, or ``CREATE FOREIGN TABLE`` statement.The Foreign Data Wrapper (FDW) syntax is:.. code-block:: 	json_fdw [OPTIONS(option=value[,...])]Parameters----------The following parameters are supported by ``json_fdw``:.. list-table::    :widths: auto   :header-rows: 1      * - Parameter     - Description   * - ``DATETIME_FORMAT``     - Default format is ``yyyy-mm-dd``. Other supported date formats are:``iso8601``, ``iso8601c``, ``dmy``, ``ymd``, ``mdy``, ``yyyymmdd``, ``yyyy-m-d``, ``yyyy-mm-dd``, ``yyyy/m/d``, ``yyyy/mm/dd``, ``d/m/yyyy``, ``dd/mm/yyyy``, ``mm/dd/yyyy``, ``dd-mon-yyyy``, ``yyyy-mon-dd``.     * - ``IGNORE_EXTRA_FIELDS``     - Default value is ``false``. When value is ``true``, key names which do not have corresponding SQream table columns will be ignored. Parameter may be used with the ``COPY TO`` and ``IGNORE FOREIGN TABLE`` statements.    * - ``COMPRESSION``     - Supported values are ``auto``, ``gzip``, and ``none``. ``auto`` means that the compression type is automatically detected upon import. Parameter is not supported for exporting. ``gzip`` means that a ``gzip`` compression is applied. ``none`` means that no compression or an attempt to decompress will take place.    * - ``LOCATION``     - A path on the local filesystem, on S3, or on HDFS URI. The local path must be an absolute path that SQream DB can access.   * - ``LIMIT``     - When specified, tells SQream DB to stop ingesting after the specified number of rows. Unlimited if unset.   * - ``OFFSET``     - The row number from which to start ingesting.   * - ``ERROR_LOG``     - If when using the ``COPY`` command, copying a row fails, the ``ERROR LOG`` command writes error information to the error log specified in the ``ERROR LOG`` command.         * If an existing file path is specified, the file will be overwritten.                  * Specifying the same file for ``ERROR_LOG`` and ``REJECTED_DATA`` is not allowed and will result in error.                  * Specifying an error log when creating a foreign table will write a new error log for every query on the foreign table.   * - ``CONTINUE_ON_ERROR``     - Specifies if errors should be ignored or skipped. When set to true, the transaction will continue despite rejected data. This parameter should be set together with ``ERROR_COUNT``. When reading multiple files, if an entire file cannot be opened, it will be skipped.   * - ``ERROR_COUNT``     - Specifies the maximum number of faulty records that will be ignored. This setting must be used in conjunction with ``continue_on_error``.   * - ``MAX_FILE_SIZE``     - Sets the maximum file size (bytes).   * - ``ENFORCE_SINGLE_FILE``     - Permitted values are ``true`` or ``false``. When set to ``true``, a single file of unlimited size is created. This single file is not limited by the ``MAX_FILE_SIZE`` parameter. ``false`` permits creating several files together limited by the ``MAX_FILE_SIZE`` parameter. Default value: ``false``.   * - ``AWS_ID``, ``AWS_SECRET``     - Specifies the authentication details for secured S3 buckets. Automatic Schema Inference--------------------------You may let SQream DB automatically infer the schema of a foreign table when using ``json_fdw``. For more information, follow the :ref:`Automatic Foreign Table DDL Resolution<automatic_foreign_table_ddl_resolution>` page.Automatic Schema Inference example:.. code-block:: postgres   	CREATE FOREIGN TABLE nba	WRAPPER	  json_fdw	OPTIONS	  (LOCATION = 's3://sqream-docs/nba.json');Examples--------JSON objects:.. code-block:: json	[	{ "name":"Avery Bradley", "age":25, "position":"PG" },	{ "name":"Jae Crowder", "age":25, "position":"SF" },	{ "name":"John Holland", "age":27, "position":"SG" }	]Using the ``COPY FROM`` statement:.. code-block:: postgres   	COPY	  nba	FROM	WRAPPER	  json_fdw	OPTIONS	  (LOCATION = 's3://sqream-docs/nba.json');Note that JSON files generated using the ``COPY TO`` statement will store objects, and not object arrays... code-block:: postgres   	COPY 	  nba	TO 	WRAPPER 	  json_fdw	OPTIONS	(location = 's3://sqream-docs/nba.json');When using the ``CREATE FOREIGN TABLE`` statement, make sure that the table schema corresponds with the JSON file structure... code-block:: postgres   	CREATE FOREIGN TABLE t (id int not null)	WRAPPER	  json_fdw	OPTIONS	  (location = 'sqream-docs.json');The following is an example of loading data from a JSON file into SQream:.. code-block:: postgres	WRAPPER	  json_fdw	OPTIONS	  (LOCATION = 'sqream-docs.json');	  .. tip::    An exact match must exist between the SQream and JSON types. For unsupported column types, you can set the type to any type and exclude it from subsequent queries.
