Inserting Data from a Parquet File

1. Prepare the files
=====================

Prepare the source Parquet files, with the following requirements:

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   
   * -   SQream DB type â†’
   
         Parquet source
     - ``BOOL``
     - ``TINYINT``
     - ``SMALLINT``
     - ``INT``
     - ``BIGINT``
     - ``REAL``
     - ``DOUBLE``
     - Text [#f0]_
     - ``DATE``
     - ``DATETIME``
   * - ``BOOLEAN``
     - Supported 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
   * - ``INT16``
     - 
     - 
     - Supported
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
   * - ``INT32``
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - Supported
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
   * - ``INT64``
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - Supported
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
   * - ``FLOAT``
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - Supported
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
   * - ``DOUBLE``
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - Supported
     - 
     - 
     - 
   * - ``BYTE_ARRAY`` / ``FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY`` [#f2]_
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - Supported
     - 
     - 
   * - ``INT96`` [#f3]_
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - Supported [#f4]_

* If a Parquet file has an unsupported type like ``enum``, ``uuid``, ``time``, ``json``, ``bson``, ``lists``, ``maps``, but the data is not referenced in the table (it does not appear in the :ref:`SELECT` query), the statement will succeed. If the column is referenced, an error will be thrown to the user, explaining that the type is not supported, but the column may be ommited. This can be worked around. See more information in the examples.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f0] Text values include ``TEXT``.

.. [#f2] With UTF8 annotation.

.. [#f3] With ``TIMESTAMP_NANOS`` or ``TIMESTAMP_MILLIS`` annotation.

.. [#f4] Any microseconds will be rounded down to milliseconds.

2. Place Parquet files where SQream DB workers can access them
================================================================

Any worker may try to access files (unless explicitly speficied with the :ref:`workload_manager`).
It is important that every node has the same view of the storage being used - meaning, every SQream DB worker should have access to the files.

* For files hosted on NFS, ensure that the mount is accessible from all servers.

* For HDFS, ensure that SQream DB servers can access the HDFS name node with the correct user-id. See our :ref:`hdfs` guide for more information.

* For S3, ensure network access to the S3 endpoint. See our :ref:`s3` guide for more information.


3. Figure out the table structure
===============================================

Prior to loading data, you will need to write out the table structure, so that it matches the file structure.

For example, to import the data from ``nba.parquet``, we will first look at the source table:

.. csv-table:: nba.parquet
   :file: nba-t10.csv
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1 

* The file is stored on S3, at ``s3://sqream-demo-data/nba.parquet``.


We will make note of the file structure to create a matching ``CREATE FOREIGN TABLE`` statement.

.. code-block:: postgres
   
   CREATE FOREIGN TABLE ext_nba
   (
      "Name" varchar(40),
      "Team" varchar(40),
      "Number" tinyint,
      "Position" varchar(2),
      "Age" tinyint,
      "Height" varchar(4),
      "Weight" real,
      "College" varchar(40),
      "Salary" float
    )
    WRAPPER parquet_fdw
    OPTIONS
    (
      LOCATION =  's3://sqream-demo-data/nba.parquet'
    );

.. tip:: 

   Types in SQream DB must match Parquet types exactly.
   
   If the column type isn't supported, a possible workaround is to set it to any arbitrary type and then exclude it from subsequent queries.


4. Verify table contents
====================================

Foreign tables do not verify file integrity or structure, so verify that the table definition matches up and contains the correct data.

.. code-block:: psql
   
   t=> SELECT * FROM ext_nba LIMIT 10;
   Name          | Team           | Number | Position | Age | Height | Weight | College           | Salary  
   --------------+----------------+--------+----------+-----+--------+--------+-------------------+---------
   Avery Bradley | Boston Celtics |      0 | PG       |  25 | 6-2    |    180 | Texas             |  7730337
   Jae Crowder   | Boston Celtics |     99 | SF       |  25 | 6-6    |    235 | Marquette         |  6796117
   John Holland  | Boston Celtics |     30 | SG       |  27 | 6-5    |    205 | Boston University |         
   R.J. Hunter   | Boston Celtics |     28 | SG       |  22 | 6-5    |    185 | Georgia State     |  1148640
   Jonas Jerebko | Boston Celtics |      8 | PF       |  29 | 6-10   |    231 |                   |  5000000
   Amir Johnson  | Boston Celtics |     90 | PF       |  29 | 6-9    |    240 |                   | 12000000
   Jordan Mickey | Boston Celtics |     55 | PF       |  21 | 6-8    |    235 | LSU               |  1170960
   Kelly Olynyk  | Boston Celtics |     41 | C        |  25 | 7-0    |    238 | Gonzaga           |  2165160
   Terry Rozier  | Boston Celtics |     12 | PG       |  22 | 6-2    |    190 | Louisville        |  1824360
   Marcus Smart  | Boston Celtics |     36 | PG       |  22 | 6-4    |    220 | Oklahoma State    |  3431040

If any errors show up at this stage, verify the structure of the Parquet files and match them to the foreign table structure you created.

5. Copying data into SQream DB
===================================

To load the data into SQream DB, use the :ref:`create_table_as` statement:

.. code-block:: postgres
   
   CREATE TABLE nba AS
      SELECT * FROM ext_nba;

Working around unsupported column types
---------------------------------------------

Suppose you only want to load some of the columns - for example, if one of the columns isn't supported.

By ommitting unsupported columns from queries that access the ``FOREIGN TABLE``, they will never be called, and will not cause a "type mismatch" error.

For this example, assume that the ``Position`` column isn't supported because of its type.

.. code-block:: postgres
   
   CREATE TABLE nba AS
      SELECT Name, Team, Number, NULL as Position, Age, Height, Weight, College, Salary FROM ext_nba;
   
   -- We ommitted the unsupported column `Position` from this query, and replaced it with a default ``NULL`` value, to maintain the same table structure.


Modifying data during the copy process
------------------------------------------

One of the main reasons for staging data with ``FOREIGN TABLE`` is to examine the contents and modify them before loading them.

Assume we are unhappy with weight being in pounds, because we want to use kilograms instead. We can apply the transformation as part of the :ref:`create_table_as` statement.

Similar to the previous example, we will also set the ``Position`` column as a default ``NULL``.

.. code-block:: postgres
   
   CREATE TABLE nba AS 
      SELECT name, team, number, NULL as position, age, height, (weight / 2.205) as weight, college, salary 
              FROM ext_nba
              ORDER BY weight;


Further Parquet loading examples
=======================================

:ref:`create_foreign_table` contains several configuration options. See more in :ref:`the CREATE FOREIGN TABLE parameters section<cft_parameters>`.


Loading a table from a directory of Parquet files on HDFS
------------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: postgres

   CREATE FOREIGN TABLE ext_users
     (id INT NOT NULL, name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT NOT NULL)  
   WRAPPER parquet_fdw
   OPTIONS
     (
        LOCATION =  'hdfs://hadoop-nn.piedpiper.com/rhendricks/users/*.parquet'
     );
   
   CREATE TABLE users AS SELECT * FROM ext_users;

Loading a table from a bucket of files on S3
-----------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: postgres

   CREATE FOREIGN TABLE ext_users
     (id INT NOT NULL, name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT NOT NULL)  
   WRAPPER parquet_fdw
   OPTIONS
     ( LOCATION = 's3://pp-secret-bucket/users/*.parquet',
       AWS_ID = 'our_aws_id',
       AWS_SECRET = 'our_aws_secret'
      );
   
   CREATE TABLE users AS SELECT * FROM ext_users;
