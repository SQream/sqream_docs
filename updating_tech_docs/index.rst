Updating the Documentation Slack Channel
***********************
As a common courtesy to all SQream users, I've created the **new_in_tech_docs** Slack channel to inform internal users of changes I've made to the live documentation. I try to update this either on a weekly basis, if relevant, and leave a dedicated message when I've published release notes.

For an example of previous messages, see the Slack channel `new_in_tech_docs <https://app.slack.com/client/T0ARL90PK/C03P0R5JT7B>`_
