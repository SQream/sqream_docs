Query Split
****************************

The split query operation optimizes long-running queries by executing them in parallel on different GPUs, reducing overall runtime. This involves breaking down a complex query into parallel executions on small data subsets. To ensure an ordered result set aligned with the original complex query, two prerequisites are essential. First, create an empty table mirroring the original result set's structure. Second, define the ``@@SetResult`` operator to split the query using an ``INTEGER``, ``DATE``, or ``DATETIME`` column, as these types are compatible with the operator's ``min`` and ``max`` variables.   

Splitting is exclusive to the UI, utilizing Meta-scripting, a unique UI feature. Keep in mind that not all queries benefit, as this method introduces overhead runtime.

Syntax
========

Creating an empty table mirroring the original query result set's structure using the same DDL: 

.. code-block:: sql

	CREATE TABLE <final_result_table> 
	AS 
	(
	  SELECT 
	    <column_to_split_by> [,...]
	  FROM 
	    <my_table>
	  WHERE
	    <false_filter>
	)
	
	-- A false_filter example: 1=2
	
Defining the ``@@setresult`` operator to split the original query using an ``INTEGER``, ``DATE``, or ``DATETIME`` column with ``min`` and ``max`` variables.

.. code-block:: sql
	
	@@SetResult minMax
	SELECT min(<integer_column>) AS min, max(<integer_column>) AS max 
	FROM 
	  <my_table>
	[WHERE <condition>]


Defining the operator that determines the number of instances (splits) based on the data type of the column by which the query is split:
	
* **INTEGER column:** use the ``@@SplitQueryByNumber`` operator
	
.. code-block:: sql
	
	@@SplitQueryByNumber instances = <number of instances>, from = minMax[0].min, to = minMax[0].max
	INSERT INTO <final_result_table>
	(
	  SELECT 
	    <column_to_split_by> [,...]
	  FROM
	    <my_table>
	  WHERE
	  <column_to_split_by> between ${from} and ${to}
	)
	
* **DATE column:** use the ``@@SplitQueryByDate`` operator

.. code-block:: sql
	
	@@SplitQueryByDate instances = <number of instances>, from = minMax[0].min, to = minMax[0].max
	INSERT INTO <final_result_table>
	(
	  SELECT
	    <column_to_split_by> [,...]
	  FROM 
	    <my_table>
	  WHERE 
	    <column_to_split_by> between ${from} and ${to}
	)
	
* **DATETIME column:** use the ``@@SplitQueryByDateTime`` operator

.. code-block:: sql
	
	@@SplitQueryByDateTime instances = <number of instances>, from = minMax[0].min, to = minMax[0].max
	INSERT INTO <final_result_table>
	(
	  SELECT 
	    <column_to_split_by> [,...]
	  FROM 
	    <my_table>
	  WHERE <column_to_split_by> between ${from} and ${to}
	)
	
Outputting the results of your small queries by running a query that gathers the results of all small queries into the initially created empty table.

.. code-block:: sql

	-- Basic execution for queries which do not use aggregations:
	
	SELECT * 
	FROM 
	  <final_result_table>
	;
	
	-- Execution for queries which use aggregations:
	
	SELECT 
	  <column1>, [,...],
	  [SUM([DISTINCT] expr) AS <sum_column>], 
	  [SUM(count_column) AS <sum_count_column>],
	  [SUM(avg_column1) / SUM(avg_column2) AS <avg_column>]
	FROM 
	  <final_result_table>
	GROUP BY 
	  <column1>, <column2> [,...]
	ORDER BY 
	  <column4>
	
	-- Do not use a WHERE clause

Example
========

To split your first query, create the following table and insert data into it:

.. code-block:: sql

	CREATE TABLE MyTable (
	  id INT,
	  name TEXT NOT NULL,
	  age INT,
	  salary INT,
	  quantity INT 
	  );

	-- Inserting data into the table
	INSERT INTO MyTable (id, name, age, salary, quantity)
	VALUES
	  (1, 'John', 25, 50000, 10),
	  (2, 'Jane', 30, 60000, 20),
	  (3, 'Bob', 28, 55000, 15),
	  (4, 'Emily', 35, 70000, 18),
	  (5, 'David', 32, 62000, 22),
	  (6, 'Sarah', 27, 52000, 12),
	  (7, 'Michael', 40, 75000, 17),

	  (16, 'Ella', 34, 67000, 24),
	  (17, 'James', 28, 55000, 11),
	  (18, 'Grace', 39, 72000, 26),
	  (19, 'Benjamin', 30, 60000, 18),
	  (20, 'Chloe', 25, 50000, 14),
	  (21, 'Logan', 38, 71000, 20),
	  (22, 'Mia', 27, 52000, 16),
	  (23, 'Christopher', 32, 62000, 22),

	  (25, 'Lily', 36, 68000, 15),
	  (26, 'Jackson', 31, 58000, 23),
	  (27, 'Harper', 24, 49000, 12),
	  (28, 'Ethan', 35, 70000, 17),
	  (29, 'Isabella', 22, 48000, 25),
	  (30, 'Carter', 37, 69000, 14),
	  (31, 'Amelia', 26, 51000, 21),
	  (32, 'Lucas', 33, 64000, 19),
	  (33, 'Abigail', 28, 55000, 16),
	  (34, 'Mason', 39, 72000, 18),
	  (35, 'Evelyn', 30, 60000, 25),
	  (36, 'Alexander', 23, 47000, 13),
	  (37, 'Addison', 34, 67000, 22),
	  (38, 'Henry', 25, 50000, 20),
	  (39, 'Avery', 36, 68000, 15),
	  (40, 'Sebastian', 29, 56000, 24),
	  (41, 'Layla', 31, 58000, 11),

	  (43, 'Nora', 27, 52000, 19),
	  (44, 'Grayson', 32, 62000, 17),
	  (45, 'Scarlett', 24, 49000, 14),
	  (46, 'Gabriel', 35, 70000, 23),
	  (47, 'Hannah', 22, 48000, 16),
	  (48, 'Eli', 37, 69000, 25),
	  (49, 'Paisley', 28, 55000, 18),
	  (50, 'Owen', 33, 64000, 12);

Next, we'll split the following query:

	.. code-block:: sql

		SELECT
		  age,
		  COUNT(*) AS total_people,
		  AVG(salary) AS avg_salary,
		  SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity,
		  SUM(CASE WHEN quantity > 20 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS high_quantity_count,
		  SUM(CASE WHEN age BETWEEN 25 AND 30 THEN salary ELSE 0 END) AS total_salary_age_25_30
		FROM
		  MyTable
		WHERE
		  salary > 55000
		GROUP BY
		  age
		ORDER BY
		  age;

1. Prepare the following:

 a. An empty table mirroring the original query result setâ€™s structure with the same DDL, using a false filter under the ``WHERE`` clause:
 
    An empty table named ``FinalResult`` is created.	
	
	.. code-block:: sql

		CREATE OR TABLE FinalResult
		AS
		(
		  SELECT
		  age,
		  COUNT(*) AS total_people,
		  AVG(salary) AS avg_salary,
		  SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity,
		  SUM(CASE WHEN quantity > 20 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS high_quantity_count,
		  SUM(CASE WHEN age BETWEEN 25 AND 30 THEN salary ELSE 0 END) AS total_salary_age_25_30
		FROM
		  MyTable
		WHERE
		  1=0
		  AND salary > 55000
		GROUP BY
		  age
		ORDER BY
		  age
		  );		
		

	
 b. The ``@@setresult`` operator to split the original query:
	
	.. code-block:: sql

		@@ SetResult minMax
		SELECT min(id) as min, max(id) as max 
		FROM mytable
		;

 c. The operator that determines the number of instances (splits) of your query, based on an ``INTEGER`` column:

	.. code-block:: sql

		@@SplitQueryByNumber instances = 4, from = minMax[0].min, to = minMax[0].max
		INSERT INTO FinalResult
		(
		SELECT
		  age,
		  COUNT(*) AS total_people,
		  AVG(salary) AS avg_salary,
		  SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity,
		  SUM(CASE WHEN quantity > 20 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS high_quantity_count,
		  SUM(CASE WHEN age BETWEEN 25 AND 30 THEN salary ELSE 0 END) AS total_salary_age_25_30
		FROM
		  MyTable
		WHERE
		  id between ${from} and ${to}
		  AND salary > 55000
		GROUP BY
		  age
		ORDER BY
		  age
		  );
	
 d. A query that gathers the results of all small queries into the initially created empty table:

	.. code-block:: sql

		SELECT
		  age,
		  SUM(total_people) AS total_people,
		  SUM(avg_salary) / SUM(avg_salary) AS avg_salary,
		  SUM(total_quantity) AS total_quantity,
		  SUM(high_quantity_count) AS high_quantity_count,
		  SUM(total_salary_age_25_30) AS total_salary_age_25_30
		FROM
		  FinalResult
		GROUP BY
		  age
		ORDER BY
		  age
		  ;

2. Paste ALL five scripts into one Editor tab.

3. Ensure that each script ends with its own ``;``.

4. Ensure that the **Execute** button is set to **All**.

5. Select the **Execute** button.

   All five scripts are executed, resulting in the splitting of the initial query and a final result set.
