Audit Log
***********************
An **Audit Log**, also known as an audit trail, is a record of system events, such as an activity or sequence of activities. Audit logs typically record what activities were performed, by who, and how your system responded. Such logs provide administrators a complete track record of your system operations, providing valuable insight into examining suspicious activity and diagnosing and troubleshooting specific issues. Audit logs can be used to enhance security by monitoring data and systems for vulnerabilities, identifying the misuse of internal data, and certify whether and to what degree users comply with document protocols. 

The Audit Log feature stores logs as separate files, which you can use query and analyze using the auditlog command. Some common uses of the auditlog command are viewing executed SQL statements, session and query IDs, login and logout events, and user triggered responses, such as errors.
