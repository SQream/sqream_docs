Foreign Tables
**************
Foreign tables can be used to run queries directly on data without inserting it into SQream DB first.
SQream DB supports read only foreign tables, so you can query from foreign tables, but you cannot insert to them, or run deletes or updates on them.

Running queries directly on foreign data is most effectively used for things like one off querying. If you will be repeatedly querying data, the performance will usually be better if you insert the data into SQream DB first.

Although foreign tables can be used without inserting data into SQream DB, one of their main use cases is to help with the insertion process. An insert select statement on a foreign table can be used to insert data into SQream using the full power of the query engine to perform ETL.


   
Supported Data Formats
======================
SQream DB supports foreign tables over:

* Text files (e.g. CSV, PSV, TSV)
* ORC
* Parquet

Supported Data Staging
======================
SQream can stage data from:

* a local filesystem (e.g. ``/mnt/storage/....``)
* :ref:`s3` buckets (e.g. ``s3://pp-secret-bucket/users/*.parquet``)
* :ref:`hdfs` (e.g. ``hdfs://hadoop-nn.piedpiper.com/rhendricks/*.csv``)

Using Foreign Tables
=====================
Use a foreign table to stage data before loading from CSV, Parquet or ORC files.

Planning for Data Staging
-------------------------
For the following examples, we will want to interact with a CSV file. Here's a peek at the table contents:
  
.. csv-table:: nba.csv
   :file: nba-t10.csv
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1

The file is stored on :ref:`s3`, at ``s3://sqream-demo-data/nba_players.csv``.
We will make note of the file structure, to create a matching ``CREATE_EXTERNAL_TABLE`` statement.

Creating a Foreign Table
--------------------------
Based on the source file structure, we we :ref:`create a foreign table<create_external_table>` with the appropriate structure, and point it to the file.

.. code-block:: sql
   
   CREATE FOREIGN TABLE nba
   (
      Name varchar,
      Team varchar,
      Number tinyint,
      Position varchar,
      Age tinyint,
      Height varchar,
      Weight real,
      College varchar,
      Salary float
    )
      USING FORMAT CSV -- Text file
      WITH  PATH  's3://sqream-demo-data/nba_players.csv' 
      RECORD DELIMITER '\r\n'; -- DOS delimited file

The file format in this case is CSV, and it is stored as an :ref:`s3` object (if the path is on :ref:`hdfs`, change the URI accordingly).
We also took note that the record delimiter was a DOS newline (``\r\n``).

Querying Foreign Tables
------------------------

Let's peek at the data from the foreign table:

.. code-block:: sql
   
   t=> SELECT * FROM nba LIMIT 10;
   name          | team           | number | position | age | height | weight | college           | salary  
   --------------+----------------+--------+----------+-----+--------+--------+-------------------+---------
   Avery Bradley | Boston Celtics |      0 | PG       |  25 | 6-2    |    180 | Texas             |  7730337
   Jae Crowder   | Boston Celtics |     99 | SF       |  25 | 6-6    |    235 | Marquette         |  6796117
   John Holland  | Boston Celtics |     30 | SG       |  27 | 6-5    |    205 | Boston University |         
   R.J. Hunter   | Boston Celtics |     28 | SG       |  22 | 6-5    |    185 | Georgia State     |  1148640
   Jonas Jerebko | Boston Celtics |      8 | PF       |  29 | 6-10   |    231 |                   |  5000000
   Amir Johnson  | Boston Celtics |     90 | PF       |  29 | 6-9    |    240 |                   | 12000000
   Jordan Mickey | Boston Celtics |     55 | PF       |  21 | 6-8    |    235 | LSU               |  1170960
   Kelly Olynyk  | Boston Celtics |     41 | C        |  25 | 7-0    |    238 | Gonzaga           |  2165160
   Terry Rozier  | Boston Celtics |     12 | PG       |  22 | 6-2    |    190 | Louisville        |  1824360
   Marcus Smart  | Boston Celtics |     36 | PG       |  22 | 6-4    |    220 | Oklahoma State    |  3431040

Modifying Data from Staging
---------------------------
One of the main reasons for staging data is to examine the contents and modify them before loading them.
Assume we are unhappy with weight being in pounds, because we want to use kilograms instead. We can apply the transformation as part of a query:

.. code-block:: sql
   
   t=> SELECT name, team, number, position, age, height, (weight / 2.205) as weight, college, salary 
   .          FROM nba
   .          ORDER BY weight;

   name                     | team                   | number | position | age | height | weight   | college               | salary  
   -------------------------+------------------------+--------+----------+-----+--------+----------+-----------------------+---------
   Nikola Pekovic           | Minnesota Timberwolves |     14 | C        |  30 | 6-11   |  139.229 |                       | 12100000
   Boban Marjanovic         | San Antonio Spurs      |     40 | C        |  27 | 7-3    | 131.5193 |                       |  1200000
   Al Jefferson             | Charlotte Hornets      |     25 | C        |  31 | 6-10   | 131.0658 |                       | 13500000
   Jusuf Nurkic             | Denver Nuggets         |     23 | C        |  21 | 7-0    | 126.9841 |                       |  1842000
   Andre Drummond           | Detroit Pistons        |      0 | C        |  22 | 6-11   | 126.5306 | Connecticut           |  3272091
   Kevin Seraphin           | New York Knicks        |      1 | C        |  26 | 6-10   | 126.0771 |                       |  2814000
   Brook Lopez              | Brooklyn Nets          |     11 | C        |  28 | 7-0    | 124.7166 | Stanford              | 19689000
   Jahlil Okafor            | Philadelphia 76ers     |      8 | C        |  20 | 6-11   | 124.7166 | Duke                  |  4582680
   Cristiano Felicio        | Chicago Bulls          |      6 | PF       |  23 | 6-10   | 124.7166 |                       |   525093
   [...]

Now, if we're happy with the results, we can convert the staged foreign table to a standard table

Converting a Foreign Table to a Standard Database Table
---------------------------------------------------------

:ref:`create_table_as` can be used to materialize a foreign table into a regular table.

.. tip:: If you intend to use the table multiple times, convert the foreign table to a standard table.

.. code-block:: sql
   
   t=> CREATE TABLE real_nba AS 
   .    SELECT name, team, number, position, age, height, (weight / 2.205) as weight, college, salary 
   .            FROM nba
   .            ORDER BY weight;
   executed
   t=> SELECT * FROM real_nba LIMIT 5;

   name             | team                   | number | position | age | height | weight   | college     | salary  
   -----------------+------------------------+--------+----------+-----+--------+----------+-------------+---------
   Nikola Pekovic   | Minnesota Timberwolves |     14 | C        |  30 | 6-11   |  139.229 |             | 12100000
   Boban Marjanovic | San Antonio Spurs      |     40 | C        |  27 | 7-3    | 131.5193 |             |  1200000
   Al Jefferson     | Charlotte Hornets      |     25 | C        |  31 | 6-10   | 131.0658 |             | 13500000
   Jusuf Nurkic     | Denver Nuggets         |     23 | C        |  21 | 7-0    | 126.9841 |             |  1842000
   Andre Drummond   | Detroit Pistons        |      0 | C        |  22 | 6-11   | 126.5306 | Connecticut |  3272091

Error Handling and Limitations
==============================
* Error handling in foreign tables is limited. Any error that occurs during source data parsing will result in the statement aborting.

* 
   Foreign tables are logical and do not contain any data, their structure is not verified or enforced until a query uses the table.
   For example, a CSV with the wrong delimiter may cause a query to fail, even though the table has been created successfully:
   
   .. code-block:: sql
      
      t=> SELECT * FROM nba;
      master=> select * from nba;
      Record delimiter mismatch during CSV parsing. User defined line delimiter \n does not match the first delimiter \r\n found in s3://sqream-demo-data/nba.csv
* Since the data for a foreign table is not stored in SQream DB, it can be changed or removed at any time by a foreign process. As a result, the same query can return different results each time it runs against a foreign table. Similarly, a query might fail if the foreign data is moved, removed, or has changed structure.
