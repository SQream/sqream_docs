***********************
Creating Numbered Lists
***********************
The following is the syntax for numbered lists:

.. code-block:: console

   1. Bullet 1
   2. Bullet 2
   3. Bullet 3

You can also use the following automatic numbering syntax:

.. code-block:: console

   1. Bullet 1
   #. Bullet 2
   #. Bullet 3

.. note:: Inserting syntax, such as with extra lines, a note, or an image, between lines disables automatic numbering.
