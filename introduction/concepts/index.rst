Concepts
=====================================

SQream DB is the GPU-accelerated analytics SQL database for massive data. SQream DB provides a data warehouse that is fast, flexible, and extremely scalable when compared to traditional data warehouses.

While similar to some data warehouses, SQream DB has additional functionality and capabilities designed to handle very lage data sets. 

While most users don't need to understand the underlying architecture and concepts to use SQream DB, many users have questions about how SQream DB works. This guide details the workings of SQream DB.
