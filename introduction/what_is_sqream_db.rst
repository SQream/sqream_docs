What is SQream DB
*****************

SQream DB is a columnar SQL RDBMS. It is is built to use GPU acceleration to load and analyze large amounts of data, in excess of the RAM resources for the machine. SQream DB scales horizontally for added concurrency, supports isolated serializable transactions, and provides a common SQL interface for querying data.

Customers with SQream DB often deploy it for sizes ranging from 5TB to 1PB. Depending on the workload, 1PB can be supported on a single node, with a fast and large enough storage. 

Common deployment techniques for SQream DB is for expanding historical analytics by orders of magnitude, such as expanding from 3 day windows to 3 months.
