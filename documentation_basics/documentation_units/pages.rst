What Are Pages?
***********************
**Pages** are the smallest documentation unit in the hierarchy and are used for describing individual features and other forms of documentation. All page files must be located in the **same folder** as their index file to create an association with it.

You can create pages in one of the following ways:

* **Remotely** - :ref:`adding_individual_files`

   ::

* **Locally** - :ref:`creating_new_files`
