What Are Folders?
***********************
**Folders** are the same as folders in all Explorer applications, and are used for storing files. You need folders to organize your content to correctly create the topic menu. Every folder must contain an index file, but should also contain more than one regular documentation files. Creating a folder itself will not display its page contents on the front-end. For the page contents to be displayed in the topic menu, a folder must have an index file.
