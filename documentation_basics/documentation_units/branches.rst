What Are Branches?
***********************
**Branches** are the second largest documentation unit, and are used for dedicated scopes within a project. For example, the **sqream_docs** repository has a folder corresponding to each topic in our documentation set, such as **Getting Started**, **Installation Guides**, and so on.

You will regularly switch between branches while creating and modifying documentation.
