What Are Repositories?
***********************
A repository is the largest "unit" in the documentation hierarchy. Every project you work on, if general enough, should have its own repository. Because the documentation project is sufficiently large to have its own dedicated repository, practically speaking you will only be using the **sqream_docs** repository.

On the main GitHub remote page you'll see a long list of other repositories. These are strictly speaking dedicated to development, release management, and other coding projects. As the technical writer these are irrelevant to you and you will not be using them.

You can select a repository in one of the following ways:

* **Working in remote or local platform:** selecting a repository.

   ::

* **From the CLI:** navigating to the sqream_docs repository as follows:

  .. code-block:: console

     C:\Users\Yaniv>cd sqream_docs

.. note:: ``sqream_docs`` is the name of the main documentation repository. In the past, other documentation repositories existed for particular projects, but they have been deprecated and deleted.
