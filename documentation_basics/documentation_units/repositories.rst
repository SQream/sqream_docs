What Are Repositories?
***********************
A repository is the largest "unit" in the documentation hierarchy. Every project you work on, if general enough, should have its own repository. Because the documentation project is sufficiently large to have its own dedicated repository, practically speaking you will only be using the **sqream_docs** repository.

On the main GitHub remote page you'll see a long list of other repositories. These are strictly speaking dedicated to development, release management, and other coding projects. As the technical writer these are irrelevant to you and you will not be using them.
