********************

Data types define the type of data that a column can hold in a table. They ensure that data is handled accurately and efficiently. Common data types include integers, decimals, characters, and dates. For example, an ``INT`` data type is used for whole numbers, ``TEXT`` for variable-length character strings, and ``DATE`` for date values.
