Login and Connectors
*************************
BLUE supports the most common database tools and interfaces, giving you direct access through a variety of connectors, visualization tools, and utilities.

Log In Using the BLUE Interface
===============================

To access the BLUE interface, first, check your email for an invite from your administrator. This email will contain a URL that you will need to click to access the BLUE interface. Once you've accessed the BLUE interface, select "Log In". You will then be redirected to your Identity Provider (IDP) page, where you will need to verify your credentials. This is a one-time process. After you have verified your credentials, you will be redirected back to the BLUE interface. From your second login onward, you will be automatically redirected to the BLUE interface.

If you need a tool that BLUE does not currently support, contact our support team and we'll look into it.
