Selecting a Repository and Branch
***********************
This section describes how to select a repository.

**To select a repository:**

1. From the **Current repository** menu, click the arrow and select a repository.

   GitHub switches to the repository you selected.

2. From the **Current branch** menu, select a branch.

   The content of the branch you selected is displayed.

3. (Optional) Click **Fetch origin** to fetch content that may have been created or modified by somebody else on the remote GitHub platform. This rarely occurs when one technical writer manages all documentation, and is more likely on a team of writers.

.. note:: This may cause a version conflict. For information about resolving merge conflicts, see Resolving Merge Conflicts. **Not created yet**.

4. Click **Repository** and **Show in Explorer**.

   Explorer displays the content of the branch you selected in a separate window.
