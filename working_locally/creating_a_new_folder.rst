How to Create a New Folder
***********************
The best way to create a new folder is to copy and modify an existing folder, using the existing folder as a "template" for the required syntactical elements. For example, every folder requires an index file and at least one regular content file.

.. note:: Sections corresponding to folders with no regular content files do not appear on the menu even if they have an index file.

.. note:: For an index file, which contains the TOC tree element, to call nested files, the content files and index file must be in the same folder as each other.
