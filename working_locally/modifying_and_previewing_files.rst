How to Modify and Preview Files
***********************
Once you've created a file you can modify and preview it in tandem. To preview a file, click **Preview**. While you can preview files this way, generating a build file lets you view the page as it would appear once published.

For more information about generating build files, see :ref:`previewing_your_work`.
