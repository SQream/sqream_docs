Maintaining Your Local Folder
================================
It's a good idea to create an identical local version of your live content. The reason for this is that, when updating live content, you can simply copy and paste the needed content into live branches.

.. note:: When you copy and paste local content into your live branches, verify that you've updated all absolute links, and that you're only copying the content that you need. For example, you may need to include **all** of the content of a local page in a later branch, but not in an earlier one.

Creating a Local Backup Folder
================================
It's also a good idea to create a local backup folder of content that you've removed from your documentation, such as entire pages or sections of pages. This has been immensely helpful when we've deprecated a certain feature (or part of a feature) to be reinstated at a later date. In such cases you can easily and quickly restore your locally saved content into the required files.
