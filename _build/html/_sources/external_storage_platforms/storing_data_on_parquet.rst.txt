Storing Data on Parquet
***********************
As described in the **Data Ingestion Sources** section, users can insert data into SQream from Parquet files. However, because it is an open-source column-oriented data storage format, users may want to retain their data there instead of inserting it into SQream. This requires SQream users to be able to execute queries on external Parquet files.
