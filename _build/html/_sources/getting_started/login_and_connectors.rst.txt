Login and Connectors
*************************
BLUE supports the most common database tools and interfaces, giving you direct access through a variety of connectors, visualization tools, and utilities.

Log In Using you Identity Provider
=============================== 

BLUE leverages Auth0 to enable users to log in using their own identity providers (IDPs), offer multi-factor authentication, encryption, and anomaly detection to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. 

#. To log in to the BLUE interface, first, check your email for an invite from your administrator. 

#. Once you're in, select **Log In**. 

#. You will then be redirected to your Identity Provider (IDP) page, where you will need to verify your credentials. This is a one-time process. After you have verified your credentials, you will be redirected back to the BLUE interface. 

#. From your second login onward, you will be automatically redirected to the BLUE interface.

Connectors
==========
   
Users who want to connect to BLUE from their own applications or tools may need to use connectors. Developers and data analysts are typical users who may wish to use such connectors.

If you need a tool that BLUE does not currently support, contact our support team and we'll look into it.
