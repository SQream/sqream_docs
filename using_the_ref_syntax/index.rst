Using the :ref: Syntax
***********************
Whenever possible you should use the :ref: syntax instead of absolute links. This avoids the need to manually update links when advancing from one release version to the next. The only exception to using the ``:ref:`` syntax is described on the :ref:`links_and_ref_syntax` page.
